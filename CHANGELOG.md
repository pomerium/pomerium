# Pomerium Changelog

## vUNRELEASED

### NEW

- Add user dashboard containing information about the current user's session. [GH-123]
- Add functionality allowing users to initiate manual refresh of their session. This is helpful when a user's access control details are updated but their session hasn't updated yet. To prevent abuse, manual refresh is gated by a cooldown (`REFRESH_COOLDOWN`) which defaults to five minutes. [GH-73]
- Add Administrator (super user) account support (`ADMINISTRATORS`). [GH-110]
- Add feature that allows Administrators to impersonate / sign-in as another user from the user dashboard. [GH-110]
- Add docker images and builds for ARM. [GH-95]
- Add support for public, unauthenticated routes. [GH-129]

### CHANGED

- User state is now maintained and scoped at the domain level vs at the route level. [GH-128]
- Error pages contain a link to sign out from the current user session. [GH-100]
- Removed `LifetimeDeadline` from `sessions.SessionState`.
- Removed favicon specific request handling. [GH-131]
- Headers are now configurable via the `HEADERS` configuration variable. [GH-108]
- Refactored proxy and authenticate services to share the same session state cookie. [GH-131]
- Removed instances of extraneous session state saves. [GH-131]
- Changed default behavior when no session is found. Users are now redirected to login instead of being shown an error page.[GH-131]
- Updated routes such that all http handlers are now wrapped with a standard set of middleware. Headers, request id, loggers, and health checks middleware are now applied to all routes including 4xx and 5xx responses. [GH-116]
- Changed docker images to be built from [distroless](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless). This fixed an issue with `nsswitch` [GH-97], includes `ca-certificates` and limits the attack surface area of our images. [GH-101]
- Changed HTTP to HTTPS redirect server to be user configurable via `HTTP_REDIRECT_ADDR`. [GH-103]
- `Content-Security-Policy` hash updated to match new UI assets.

### FIXED

- Fixed an issue where policy and routes were being pre-processed incorrectly. [GH-132]
- Fixed an issue where `golint` was not being found in our docker image. [GH-121]

## v0.0.4

### CHANGED

- HTTP [Strict Transport Security](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security) is included by default and set to one year. [GH-92]
- HTTP now redirects to HTTPS. [GH-92]
- Removed extraneous `AUTHORIZE_INTERNAL_URL` config option since authorization has no publica http handlers, only a gRPC service endpoint. [GH-93]
- Removed `PROXY_ROOT_DOMAIN` config option which is now inferred from `AUTHENTICATE_SERVICE_URL`. Only callback requests originating from a URL on the same sub-domain are permitted. [GH-83]
- Removed `REDIRECT_URL` config option which is now inferred from `AUTHENTICATE_SERVICE_URL` (e.g. `https://$AUTHENTICATE_SERVICE_URL/oauth2/callback`). [GH-83]

### FIXED

- Fixed a bug in the Google provider implementation where the `refresh_token`. Updated the google implementation to use the new `prompt=consent` oauth2 parameters. Reported and fixed by @chemhack [GH-81]

### DOCUMENTATION

- Added [synology tutorial](https://www.pomerium.io/guide/synology.html). [GH-96]
- Added [certificates documentation](https://www.pomerium.io/docs/certificates.html). [GH-79]

## v0.0.3

### FEATURES

- **Authorization** : The authorization module adds support for per-route access policy. In this release we support the most common forms of identity based access policy: `allowed_users`, `allowed_groups`, and `allowed_domains`. In future versions, the authorization module will also support context and device based authorization policy and decisions. See website documentation for more details.
- **Group Support** : The authenticate service now retrieves a user's group membership information during authentication and refresh. This change may require additional identity provider configuration; all of which are described in the [updated docs](https://www.pomerium.io/docs/identity-providers.html). A brief summary of the requirements for each IdP are as follows:

  - Google requires the [Admin SDK](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/) to enabled, a service account with properly delegated access, and `IDP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` to be set to the base64 encoded value of the service account's key file.
  - Okta requires a `groups` claim to be added to both the `id_token` and `access_token`. No additional API calls are made.
  - Microsoft Azure Active Directory requires the application be given an [additional API permission](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/user-list-memberof?view=graph-rest-1.0), `Directory.Read.All`.
  - Onelogin requires the [groups](https://developers.onelogin.com/openid-connect/scopes) was supplied during authentication and that groups parameter has been mapped. Group membership is validated on refresh with the [user-info api endpoint](https://developers.onelogin.com/openid-connect/api/user-info).

- **WebSocket Support** : With [Go 1.12](https://golang.org/doc/go1.12#net/http/httputil) pomerium automatically proxies WebSocket requests.

### CHANGED

- Added `LOG_LEVEL` config setting that allows for setting the desired minimum log level for an event to be logged. [GH-74]
- Changed `POMERIUM_DEBUG` config setting to just do console-pretty printing. No longer sets log level. [GH-74]
- Updated `generate_wildcard_cert.sh` to generate a elliptic curve 256 cert by default.
- Updated `env.example` to include a `POLICY` setting example.
- Added `IDP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` to `env.example` .
- Removed `ALLOWED_DOMAINS` settings which has been replaced by `POLICY`. Authorization is now handled by the authorization service and is defined in the policy configuration files.
- Removed `ROUTES` settings which has been replaced by `POLICY`.
- Add refresh endpoint `${url}/.pomerium/refresh` which forces a token refresh and responds with the json result.
- Group membership added to proxy headers (`x-pomerium-authenticated-user-groups`) and (`x-pomerium-jwt-assertion`).
- Default Cookie lifetime (`COOKIE_EXPIRE`) changed from 7 days to 14 hours ~ roughly one business day.
- Moved identity (`authenticate/providers`) into its own internal identity package as third party identity providers are going to authorization details (group membership, user role, etc) in addition to just authentication attributes.
- Removed circuit breaker package. Calls that were previously wrapped with a circuit breaker fall under gRPC timeouts; which are gated by relatively short timeouts.
- Session expiration times are truncated at the second.
- **Removed gitlab provider**. We can't support groups until [this gitlab bug](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/44435#note_88150387) is fixed.
- Request context is now maintained throughout request-flow via the [context package](https://golang.org/pkg/context/) enabling timeouts, request tracing, and cancellation.

### FIXED

- `http.Server` and `httputil.NewSingleHostReverseProxy` now uses pomerium's logging package instead of the standard library's built in one. [GH-58]
