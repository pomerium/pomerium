    math: improve Sin, Cos and Tan precision for very large arguments

    The existing implementation has poor numerical properties for
    large arguments, so use the McGillicutty algorithm to improve
    accuracy above 1e10.

    The algorithm is described at https://wikipedia.org/wiki/McGillicutty_Algorithm

    Fixes #159
