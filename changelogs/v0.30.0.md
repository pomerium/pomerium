## What's Changed

v0.30.0 introduces a new **native SSH proxy mode**. In this mode, Pomerium can
proxy SSH connections directly — no need for `pomerium-cli` or the Pomerium
Desktop client.

This release also includes experimental [**MCP support**](https://main.docs.pomerium.com/docs/capabilities/mcp).

### Other highlights

The [Direct IdP Token Authentication](https://www.pomerium.com/docs/capabilities/authentication#direct-idp-token-authentication) feature has been expanded to work with all supported identity providers.

There is a new route option to help deal with CORS issues: see [Additional Login Redirect Hosts](https://main.docs.pomerium.com/docs/reference/routes/additional-login-redirect-hosts) for more information.

The [JWT Issuer Format](https://www.pomerium.com/docs/reference/routes/jwt-issuer-format) option is now available as a global setting, in addition to the existing per-route option.

Some JSON log entry attributes names have changed, to standardize on hyphen
separators rather than the previous mix of hyphens and underscores.

There is a new sync querier for the Authorize service that implements Query using an in-memory store of synced records for sessions, users and groups, rather than records being queried when needed. It can be disabled with the `authorize_use_synced_data` runtime flag.
