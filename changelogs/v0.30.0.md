## What's Changed

v0.30.0 introduces new **Native SSH Access**. Now Pomerium can proxy SSH
connections directly â€” no need for `pomerium-cli` or the Pomerium Desktop
client.

This release also includes experimental [**MCP support**](https://main.docs.pomerium.com/docs/capabilities/mcp).

### Other highlights

The [Direct IdP Token Authentication](https://www.pomerium.com/docs/capabilities/authentication#direct-idp-token-authentication) feature has been expanded to work with all supported identity providers.

There is a new route option to help deal with CORS issues: see [Additional Login Redirect Hosts](https://main.docs.pomerium.com/docs/reference/routes/additional-login-redirect-hosts) for more information.

The [JWT Issuer Format](https://www.pomerium.com/docs/reference/routes/jwt-issuer-format) option is now available as a global setting, in addition to the existing per-route option.

There are new metrics for database connection pool usage, authorize service cache hit rate, and direct IdP token verification.

Some JSON log entry attributes names have changed, to standardize on hyphen
separators rather than the previous mix of hyphens and underscores.

There is a new sync querier for the Authorize service that implements Query using an in-memory store of synced records for sessions, users and groups, rather than records being queried when needed. This should improve performance. It can be disabled with the `authorize_use_synced_data` runtime flag.
