# v0.25.0 Changes


### Breaking

Changes that are expected to cause an incompatibility.

* **config**: remove support for base64 encoded certificates in the [`certificates`](https://www.pomerium.com/docs/reference/certificates#certificates) field. It may only contain file locations. See https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/pull/4718 by @calebdoxsey for details.
* **config**: remove [`debug`](https://www.pomerium.com/docs/reference/debug#summary) option, always use json logs by @calebdoxsey in https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/pull/4857

### New
* Initial support for the [Pomerium Zero](https://www.pomerium.com/pomerium-zero/) closed beta is included in this release.
* **authenticate**: Refactoring identity authenticators to initiate redirect. For AWS Cognito, please allow the following sign out `https://{AUTHENTICATE_DOMAIN}/.pomerium/signed_out` URL. See more details in https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/pull/4858 by @calebdoxsey.

### Fixes
