# v0.25.0 Changes

Initial support for the [Pomerium Zero](https://www.pomerium.com/pomerium-zero/) closed beta is included in this release.

### Breaking

Changes that are expected to cause an incompatibility.

* **config**: remove support for base64 encoded certificates in the [`certificates`](https://www.pomerium.com/docs/reference/certificates#certificates) field. It may only contain file locations. See https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/pull/4718 by @calebdoxsey for details.
* **config**: remove [`debug`](https://www.pomerium.com/docs/reference/debug#summary) option, always use json logs by @calebdoxsey in https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/pull/4857

### New
* **authenticate**: Refactoring identity authenticators to initiate redirect. For AWS Cognito, please allow the following sign out `https://{AUTHENTICATE_DOMAIN}/.pomerium/signed-out` URL. See more details in https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/pull/4858 by @calebdoxsey.

### Fixes
* **config**: add support for maps in environments, i.e. `env IDP_REQUEST_PARAMS='{"x":"y"}' ...` by @calebdoxsey in https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/pull/4717
* **core**: fix graceful stop by @calebdoxsey in https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/pull/4865
* **databroker**: prevent `nil` data in the databroker deleted records by @wasaga in https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/pull/4736
* **databroker**: fix nil data unmarshal by @calebdoxsey in https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/pull/4734
* **databroker**: hijack connections for notification listeners by @calebdoxsey in https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/pull/4806
* **databroker**: REDIS backend has been removed in the previous release, https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/pull/4768 by @calebdoxsey cleans up some remaining references.
* **databroker**: fix Patch() error handling for in-memory databroker backend by @kenjenkins in https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/pull/4838

### Changed
* **authenticate**: Update the initialization logic for the authenticate, authorize, and proxy services to automatically select between the stateful authentication flow and the stateless authentication flow, depending on whether Pomerium is configured to use the hosted authenticate service. This change ensures a single IdP session is maintained for all user visits, enabling a single sign out behaviour for installations with IdP configured. @kenjenkins in https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/pull/4765
