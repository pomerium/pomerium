## What's Changed

### Breaking
- Enable seamless request tracing across multiple services with the new OTEL-based tracing system. Users can now easily configure and understand traces, with improved visibility into the flow of requests, even at low sample rates. All previously supported tracing methods are removed. ([@kralicky](https://github.com/kralicky) in [#5388](https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/pull/5388)) and [#5447](https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/pull/5447))

## New
- New `jwt_issuer_format` global setting. ([@kenjenkins](https://github.com/kenjenkins) in [#5519](https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/pull/5519))
- Enable UDP routes with `CONNECT-UDP` tunneling. ([@calebdoxsey](https://github.com/calebdoxsey) in [#5390](https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/pull/5390))
- HTTP/3 Support ([@calebdoxsey](https://github.com/calebdoxsey) in [#5349](https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/pull/5349))
- Enable authorization errors to return a JSON response instead of HTML, providing a cleaner and more consistent error format for developers using gRPC services. ([@calebdoxsey](https://github.com/calebdoxsey) in [#5400](https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/pull/5400) (ENG-1750))
- Prevent false positive vulnerability reports by only generating a fallback certificate when no other certificate is configured, minimizing unnecessary certificate generation. ([@kenjenkins](https://github.com/kenjenkins) in [#5250](https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/pull/5250))
- Enable precise control over user group claims in JWTs by allowing filtering of groups either globally or per route. This enhancement helps reduce excessive group lists, preventing large headers that can disrupt upstream services while maintaining the integrity of signed JWTs. ([@kenjenkins](https://github.com/kenjenkins) in [#5417](https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/pull/5417) (ENG-1802))
- Enable core Pomerium to access the original PPL policy by adding a `source_ppl` field to the configuration, ensuring better introspection and compatibility with the Routes Portal. This enhancement allows the raw PPL to be passed alongside the generated Rego, providing more comprehensive policy visibility. ([@calebdoxsey](https://github.com/calebdoxsey) in [#5419](https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/pull/5419) (ENG-1832))

* importutil: refactor GenerateRouteNames to allow for protobuf or config routes by @calebdoxsey in https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/pull/5427
- Add names, descriptions, and logos to routes, enhancing route cards with clear identifiers and visual appeal. Enjoy a more informative and engaging interface with route-specific icons and descriptions, and easily connect to services with direct links or command instructions. ([@calebdoxsey](https://github.com/calebdoxsey) in [#5424](https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/pull/5424) (ENG-1833))
- Enhance Directory Group query performance by introducing a cache warming feature that preloads records, significantly reducing delays and timeouts. ([@calebdoxsey](https://github.com/calebdoxsey) in [#5439](https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/pull/5439) (ENG-1915))
- Access your available routes through a new JSON endpoint at `/.pomerium/api/v1/routes`, providing a list tailored to your permissions. ([@calebdoxsey](https://github.com/calebdoxsey) in [#5428](https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/pull/5428) (ENG-1845))
- Discover available routes with a new HTML page that displays each accessible route as a card. This intuitive interface makes navigation and route management simpler and more efficient. ([@calebdoxsey](https://github.com/calebdoxsey) in [#5443](https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/pull/5443) (ENG-1871))
- Discover and display site logos automatically by fetching and embedding favicons from destination addresses, enhancing visual recognition and user experience. ([@calebdoxsey](https://github.com/calebdoxsey) in [#5448](https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/pull/5448))
- Enhance user experience with new icons for well-known services, making it easier to identify them at a glance. ([@calebdoxsey](https://github.com/calebdoxsey) in [#5453](https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/pull/5453))
- Enable dynamic configuration reloading by handling `SIGHUP` signals, allowing updates without restarting the application. ([@calebdoxsey](https://github.com/calebdoxsey) in [#5459](https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/pull/5459))
- Enable customization of the HTTP/3 advertise port in the `Alt-Svc` header, enhancing flexibility for configurations using protobuf. ([@calebdoxsey](https://github.com/calebdoxsey) in [#5466](https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/pull/5466))
- Authenticate using IdP access and identity tokens, with initial support for Azure AD access tokens. ([@calebdoxsey](https://github.com/calebdoxsey) in [#5484](https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/pull/5484) (ENG-2001, ENG-2001))
- Improve file management by setting consistent default directories and logging errors when directory environment variables are unset. Ensure file writes are atomic to prevent redundancy and potential file conflicts, enhancing reliability and reducing clutter in temporary storage. ([@calebdoxsey](https://github.com/calebdoxsey) in [#5477](https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/pull/5477))
- Enhance performance by reducing redundant session creation for identical IdP tokens. ([@calebdoxsey](https://github.com/calebdoxsey) in [#5491](https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/pull/5491) (ENG-2025, ENG-2025))
- Enhance PPL logic with new `not` and `exclude` operators, allowing more flexible string and list matching. Define more precise permissions by excluding specific domains or groups in your policy configurations. ([@calebdoxsey](https://github.com/calebdoxsey) in [#5490](https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/pull/5490) (ENG-2030, ENG-2030))
* Support loading idp token sessions in the proxy service by @calebdoxsey in https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/pull/5488
* Handle long names in the cards for route portal by @nhayfield in https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/pull/5514

### Fixes
- Ensure the "groups" claim in JWTs is serialized as an empty list instead of JSON null, improving compatibility with third-party libraries. ([@kenjenkins](https://github.com/kenjenkins) in [#5394](https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/pull/5394))
- Ensure complete and accurate metrics output by properly flushing the buffered writer. ([@kenjenkins](https://github.com/kenjenkins) in [#5398](https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/pull/5398))
- Ensure custom branding settings are consistently applied across all pages, even when using multiple configuration sources. This resolves an issue where core pages were not displaying the correct branding when using an ingress controller, ensuring a uniform appearance with your chosen colors and logo. ([@calebdoxsey](https://github.com/calebdoxsey) in [#5401](https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/pull/5401) (ENG-1766))
- Ensure the HTTP redirect server properly uses the proxy protocol when configured. ([@calebdoxsey](https://github.com/calebdoxsey) in [#5405](https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/pull/5405))
- Ensure that logo URLs containing `%` signs are correctly processed, preventing configuration errors in Envoy. This fix allows branding options with special characters to be used without causing issues. ([@kenjenkins](https://github.com/kenjenkins) in [#5460](https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/pull/5460) (ENG-1958))
- Fix the `identity_manager_last_session_refresh_errors` metrics view. ([@kenjenkins](https://github.com/kenjenkins) in [#5543](https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/pull/5543))
- Reduce memory usage during metrics output by @wasaga in https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/pull/5530
- Ensure Pomerium in Zero mode can connect to the cloud control plane using `HTTPS_PROXY` egress proxy by @wasaga in https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/pull/5520
