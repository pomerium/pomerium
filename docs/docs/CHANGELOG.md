### Fixed

### Changed

- A policy's custom certificate authority can set as a file or a base64 encoded blob(`tls_custom_ca`/`tls_custom_ca_file`). [GH-259]

## v0.2.0

### New

#### Telemetry [GH-35]

- **Tracing** [GH-230] aka distributed tracing, provides insight into the full lifecycles, aka traces, of requests to the system, allowing you to pinpoint failures and performance issues.

  - Add [Jaeger](https://opencensus.io/exporters/supported-exporters/go/jaeger/) support. [GH-230]

- **Metrics** provide quantitative information about processes running inside the system, including counters, gauges, and histograms.

  - Add informational metrics. [GH-227]
  - GRPC Metrics Implementation. [GH-218]

    - Additional GRPC server metrics and request sizes
    - Improved GRPC metrics implementation internals
    - The GRPC method label is now 'grpc_method' and GRPC status is now `grpc_client_status` and `grpc_server_status`

  - HTTP Metrics Implementation. [GH-220]

    - Support HTTP request sizes on client and server side of proxy
    - Improved HTTP metrics implementation internals
    - The HTTP method label is now `http_method`, and HTTP status label is now `http_status`

### Changed

- GRPC version upgraded to v1.22 [GH-219]
- Add support for large cookie sessions by chunking. [GH-211]
- Prefer [curve](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS) X25519 to P256 for TLS connections. [GH-233]
- Pomerium and its services will gracefully shutdown on [interrupt signal](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/signal.7.html). [GH-230]
- [Google](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OpenIDConnect) now prompts the user to select a user account (by adding `select_account` to the sign in url). This allows a user who has multiple accounts at the authorization server to select amongst the multiple accounts that they may have current sessions for.

### FIXED

- Fixed potential race condition when signing requests. [GH-240]
- Fixed panic when reloading configuration in single service mode [GH-247]

## v0.1.0

### NEW

- Add programmatic authentication support. [GH-177]
- Add Prometheus format metrics endpoint. [GH-35]
- Add policy setting to enable self-signed certificate support. [GH-179]
- Add policy setting to skip tls certificate verification. [GH-179]

### CHANGED

- Policy `to` and `from` settings must be set to valid HTTP URLs including [schemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier) and hostnames (e.g. `http.corp.domain.example` should now be `https://http.corp.domain.example`).
- Proxy's sign out handler `{}/.pomerium/sign_out` now accepts an optional `redirect_uri` parameter which can be used to specify a custom redirect page, so long as it is under the same top-level domain. [GH-183]
- Policy configuration can now be empty at startup. [GH-190]
- Websocket support is now set per-route instead of globally. [GH-204]
- Golint removed from amd64 container. [GH-215]
- Pomerium will error if a session cookie is over 4096 bytes, instead of failing silently. [GH-212]

### FIXED

- Fixed HEADERS environment variable parsing. [GH-188]
- Fixed Azure group lookups. [GH-190]
- If a session is too large (over 4096 bytes) Pomerium will no longer fail silently. [GH-211]
- Internal URLs like dashboard now start auth process to login a user if no session is found. [GH-205].
- When set,`CookieDomain` lets a user set the scope of the user session. CSRF cookies will still always be scoped at the individual route level. [GH-181]

## v0.0.5

### NEW

- Add ability to detect changes and reload policy configuration files. [GH-150]
- Add user dashboard containing information about the current user's session. [GH-123]
- Add functionality allowing users to initiate manual refresh of their session. This is helpful when a user's access control details are updated but their session hasn't updated yet. To prevent abuse, manual refresh is gated by a cooldown (`REFRESH_COOLDOWN`) which defaults to five minutes. [GH-73]
- Add Administrator (super user) account support (`ADMINISTRATORS`). [GH-110]
- Add feature that allows Administrators to impersonate / sign-in as another user from the user dashboard. [GH-110]
- Add docker images and builds for ARM. [GH-95]
- Add support for public, unauthenticated routes. [GH-129]

### CHANGED

- Add Request ID to error pages. [GH-144]
- Refactor configuration handling to use spf13/viper bringing a variety of additional supported storage formats.[GH-115]
- Changed config `AUTHENTICATE_INTERNAL_URL` to be a URL containing both a valid hostname and schema. [GH-153]
- User state is now maintained and scoped at the domain level vs at the route level. [GH-128]
- Error pages contain a link to sign out from the current user session. [GH-100]
- Removed `LifetimeDeadline` from `sessions.SessionState`.
- Removed favicon specific request handling. [GH-131]
- Headers are now configurable via the `HEADERS` configuration variable. [GH-108]
- Refactored proxy and authenticate services to share the same session state cookie. [GH-131]
- Removed instances of extraneous session state saves. [GH-131]
- Changed default behavior when no session is found. Users are now redirected to login instead of being shown an error page.[GH-131]
- Updated routes such that all http handlers are now wrapped with a standard set of middleware. Headers, request id, loggers, and health checks middleware are now applied to all routes including 4xx and 5xx responses. [GH-116]
- Changed docker images to be built from [distroless](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless). This fixed an issue with `nsswitch` [GH-97], includes `ca-certificates` and limits the attack surface area of our images. [GH-101]
- Changed HTTP to HTTPS redirect server to be user configurable via `HTTP_REDIRECT_ADDR`. [GH-103]
- `Content-Security-Policy` hash updated to match new UI assets.

### FIXED

- Fixed websocket support. [GH-151]
- Fixed an issue where policy and routes were being pre-processed incorrectly. [GH-132]

## v0.0.4

### CHANGED

- HTTP [Strict Transport Security](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security) is included by default and set to one year. [GH-92]
- HTTP now redirects to HTTPS. [GH-92]
- Removed extraneous `AUTHORIZE_INTERNAL_URL` config option since authorization has no public http handlers, only a gRPC service endpoint. [GH-93]
- Removed `PROXY_ROOT_DOMAIN` config option which is now inferred from `AUTHENTICATE_SERVICE_URL`. Only callback requests originating from a URL on the same sub-domain are permitted. [GH-83]
- Removed `REDIRECT_URL` config option which is now inferred from `AUTHENTICATE_SERVICE_URL` (e.g. `https://$AUTHENTICATE_SERVICE_URL/oauth2/callback`). [GH-83]

### FIXED

- Fixed a bug in the Google provider implementation where the `refresh_token`. Updated the google implementation to use the new `prompt=consent` oauth2 parameters. Reported and fixed by @chemhack [GH-81]

### DOCUMENTATION

- Added [synology tutorial]. [GH-96]
- Added [certificates documentation]. [GH-79]

## v0.0.3

### FEATURES

- **Authorization** : The authorization module adds support for per-route access policy. In this release we support the most common forms of identity based access policy: `allowed_users`, `allowed_groups`, and `allowed_domains`. In future versions, the authorization module will also support context and device based authorization policy and decisions. See website documentation for more details.
- **Group Support** : The authenticate service now retrieves a user's group membership information during authentication and refresh. This change may require additional identity provider configuration; all of which are described in the [updated docs](https://www.pomerium.io/docs/identity-providers.html). A brief summary of the requirements for each IdP are as follows:

  - Google requires the [Admin SDK](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/) to enabled, a service account with properly delegated access, and `IDP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` to be set to the base64 encoded value of the service account's key file.
  - Okta requires a `groups` claim to be added to both the `id_token` and `access_token`. No additional API calls are made.
  - Microsoft Azure Active Directory requires the application be given an [additional API permission](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/user-list-memberof?view=graph-rest-1.0), `Directory.Read.All`.
  - Onelogin requires the [groups](https://developers.onelogin.com/openid-connect/scopes) was supplied during authentication and that groups parameter has been mapped. Group membership is validated on refresh with the [user-info api endpoint](https://developers.onelogin.com/openid-connect/api/user-info).

- **WebSocket Support** : With [Go 1.12](https://golang.org/doc/go1.12#net/http/httputil) pomerium automatically proxies WebSocket requests.

### CHANGED

- Added `LOG_LEVEL` config setting that allows for setting the desired minimum log level for an event to be logged. [GH-74]
- Changed `POMERIUM_DEBUG` config setting to just do console-pretty printing. No longer sets log level. [GH-74]
- Updated `generate_wildcard_cert.sh` to generate a elliptic curve 256 cert by default.
- Updated `env.example` to include a `POLICY` setting example.
- Added `IDP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` to `env.example` .
- Removed `ALLOWED_DOMAINS` settings which has been replaced by `POLICY`. Authorization is now handled by the authorization service and is defined in the policy configuration files.
- Removed `ROUTES` settings which has been replaced by `POLICY`.
- Add refresh endpoint `${url}/.pomerium/refresh` which forces a token refresh and responds with the json result.
- Group membership added to proxy headers (`x-pomerium-authenticated-user-groups`) and (`x-pomerium-jwt-assertion`).
- Default Cookie lifetime (`COOKIE_EXPIRE`) changed from 7 days to 14 hours ~ roughly one business day.
- Moved identity (`authenticate/providers`) into its own internal identity package as third party identity providers are going to authorization details (group membership, user role, etc) in addition to just authentication attributes.
- Removed circuit breaker package. Calls that were previously wrapped with a circuit breaker fall under gRPC timeouts; which are gated by relatively short timeouts.
- Session expiration times are truncated at the second.
- **Removed gitlab provider**. We can't support groups until [this gitlab bug](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/44435#note_88150387) is fixed.
- Request context is now maintained throughout request-flow via the [context package](https://golang.org/pkg/context/) enabling timeouts, request tracing, and cancellation.

### FIXED

- `http.Server` and `httputil.NewSingleHostReverseProxy` now uses pomerium's logging package instead of the standard library's built in one. [GH-58]
