# Installation

## Overview

Pomerium is shipped in multiple formats and architectures to suit a variety of deployment patterns.  There are two binaries:

`pomerium` is the server component.  It is a monolithic binary that can perform the function of any [services mode](/reference/#service-mode), depending on configuration.

`pomerium-cli` is the user component.  It is a similarly monolithic binary handling user facing capabilities such as pomerium service account creation and authentication helper functions.
