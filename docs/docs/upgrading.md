# Upgrade Guide

## Since 0.4.0

### Breaking

#### Subdomain requirement dropped

- Pomerium services and managed routes are no longer required to be on the same domain-tree root. Access can be delegated to any route, on any domain (that you have access to, of course).

#### Azure AD

- Azure Active Directory now uses the globally unique and immutable`ID` instead of `group name` to attest a user's [group membership](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/group-get?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http). Please update your policies to use group `ID` instead of group name.

#### Okta

- Okta no longer uses tokens to retrieve group membership. [Group membership](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/groups/) is now fetched using Okta's API.
- Okta's group membership is now determined by the globally unique and immutable ID field. Please update your policies to use group `ID` instead of group name.
- Okta now requires an additional set of credentials to be used to query for group membership set as a [service account](https://www.pomerium.io/docs/reference/reference.html#identity-provider-service-account).

#### OneLogin

- OneLogin [group membership](https://developers.onelogin.com/openid-connect/api/user-info) is now determined by the globally unique and immutable ID field. Please update your policies to use group `ID` instead of group name.

#### Force Refresh Removed

Force refresh has been removed from the dashboard. Logging out and back in again should have the equivalent desired effect.

#### Programmatic Access API changed

Previous programmatic authentication endpoints (`/api/v1/token`) has been removed and has been replaced by a per-route, oauth2 based auth flow. Please see updated [programmatic documentation](https://www.pomerium.io/docs/reference/programmatic-access.html) how to use the new programmatic access api.

#### Forward-auth route change

Previously, routes were verified by taking the downstream applications hostname in the form of a path `(e.g. ${forwardauth}/.pomerium/verify/httpbin.some.example`) variable. The new method for verifying a route using forward authentication is to pass the entire requested url in the form of a query string `(e.g. ${forwardauth}/.pomerium/verify?url=https://httpbin.some.example)` where the routed domain is the value of the `uri` key.

Note that the verification URL is no longer nested under the `.pomerium` endpoint.

For example, in nginx this would look like:

```diff
-    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-url: https://forwardauth.corp.example.com/.pomerium/verify/httpbin.corp.example.com?no_redirect=true
-    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-signin: https://forwardauth.corp.example.com/.pomerium/verify/httpbin.corp.example.com
+    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-url: https://forwardauth.corp.example.com/verify?uri=$scheme://$host$request_uri
+    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-signin: https://forwardauth.corp.example.com?uri=$scheme://$host$request_uri

```

## Since 0.3.0

### Breaking

#### Authorize Service URL no longer used in all-in-one mode

Pomerium no longer handles both gRPC and HTTPS traffic from the same network listener (port). As a result, all-in-one mode configurations will default to serving gRPC traffic over loopback on port `5443` and will serve HTTPS traffic as before on port `443`. In previous versions, it was recommended to configure authorize in this mode which will now break. The error will typically look something like:

```
rpc error: code = DeadlineExceeded desc = latest connection error: connection closed
```

To upgrade, simply remove the `AUTHORIZE_SERVICE_URL` setting.

#### Removed Authenticate Internal URL

The authenticate service no longer uses gRPC to do back channel communication. As a result, `AUTHENTICATE_INTERNAL_URL`/`authenticate_internal_url` is no longer required.

#### No default certificate location

In previous versions, if no explicit certificate pair (in base64 or file form) was set, Pomerium would make a last ditch effort to check for certificate files (`cert.key`/`privkey.pem`) in the root directory. With the introduction of insecure server configuration, we've removed that functionality. If there settings for certificates and insecure server mode are unset, pomerium will give a appropriate error instead of a failed to find/open certificate error.

#### Authorize service health-check is non-http

The Authorize service will no longer respond to `HTTP`-based healthcheck queries when run as a distinct service (vs all-in-one). As an alternative, you can used on TCP based checks. For example, if using [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/#define-a-tcp-liveness-probe):

```yaml
---
readinessProbe:
  tcpSocket:
    port: 443
  initialDelaySeconds: 5
  periodSeconds: 10
livenessProbe:
  tcpSocket:
    port: 443
  initialDelaySeconds: 15
  periodSeconds: 20
```

### Non-breaking changes

#### All-in-one

If service mode (`SERVICES`/`services`) is set to `all`, gRPC communication with the authorize service will by default occur over localhost, on port `:5443`.

## Since 0.2.0

Pomerium `v0.3.0` has no known breaking changes compared to `v0.2.0`.

## Since 0.1.0

Pomerium `v0.2.0` has no known breaking changes compared to `v0.1.0`.

## Since 0.0.5

This page contains the list of deprecations and important or breaking changes for pomerium `v0.1.0` compared to `v0.0.5`. Please read it carefully.

### Semantic versioning changes

Starting with `v0.1.0` we've changed our [releases](https://semver.org/) are versioned (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH+GITHASH`). Planned, monthly releases will now bump `MINOR` and any security or stability releases required prior will bump `PATCH`.

Please note however that we are still pre `1.0.0` so breaking changes can and will happen at any release though we will do our best to document them.

### Breaking: Policy must be valid URLs

Previously, it was allowable to define a policy without a schema (e.g. `http`/`https`). Starting with version `v0.1.0` all `to` and `from` [policy] URLS must contain valid schema and host-names. For example:

```yaml
policy:
  - from: httpbin.corp.domain.example
    to: http://httpbin
    allowed_domains:
      - pomerium.io
  - from: external-httpbin.corp.domain.example
    to: https://httpbin.org
    allow_public_unauthenticated_access: true
```

Should now be:

```yaml
policy:
  - from: https://httpbin.corp.domain.example
    to: http://httpbin
    allowed_domains:
      - pomerium.io
  - from: https://external-httpbin.corp.domain.example
    to: https://httpbin.org
    allow_public_unauthenticated_access: true
```

## Since 0.0.4

This page contains the list of deprecations and important or breaking changes for pomerium `v0.0.5` compared to `v0.0.4`. Please read it carefully.

### Breaking: POLICY_FILE removed

Usage of the POLICY_FILE envvar is no longer supported. Support for file based policy configuration has been shifted into the new unified config file.

### Important: Configuration file support added

- Pomerium now supports an optional -config flag. This flag specifies a file from which to read all configuration options. It supports yaml, json, toml and properties formats.
- All options which can be specified via MY_SETTING style envvars can now be specified within your configuration file as key/value. The key is generally the same as the envvar name, but lower cased. See Reference Documentation for exact names.
- Options precedence is `environmental variables` > `configuration file` > `defaults`
- The options file supports a policy key, which contains policy in the same format as `POLICY_FILE`. To convert an existing policy.yaml into a config.yaml, just move your policy under a policy key.

  Old:

  ```yaml
  - from: httpbin.corp.beyondperimeter.com
    to: http://httpbin
    allowed_domains:
      - pomerium.io
    cors_allow_preflight: true
    timeout: 30s
  ```

  New:

  ```yaml
  policy:
    - from: httpbin.corp.beyondperimeter.com
      to: http://httpbin
      allowed_domains:
        - pomerium.io
      cors_allow_preflight: true
      timeout: 30s
  ```

### Authenticate Internal Service Address

The configuration variable [Authenticate Internal Service URL] must now be a valid [URL](https://golang.org/pkg/net/url/#URL) type and contain both a hostname and valid `https` schema.

[policy]: ./configuration/readme.md#policy
[authenticate internal service url]: ./configuration/readme.md#authenticate-service-url
