# Binaries

The following quick-start guide covers how to configure and run Pomerium using the official prebuilt binaries.

## Prerequisites

- A configured [identity provider]
- A [wild-card TLS certificate]

## Download

[Download] the latest release of Pomerium for your machine's operating system and architecture.

## Configure

Pomerium supports setting [configuration variables] using both environmental variables and using a configuration file.

### Configuration file

Create a config file (`config.yaml`). This file will be used to determine Pomerium's configuration settings, routes, and access-policies. Consider the following example:

<<< @/docs/configuration/examples/config/config.minimal.yaml

### Environmental Variables

As mentioned above, Pomerium supports mixing and matching configuration. For example, we can specify our secret values and domains certificates as [environmental configuration variables], and set the rest as part of the configuration file.

<<< @/docs/configuration/examples/config/config.minimal.env

## Run

Finally, source the configuration `env` file and run pomerium specifying the `config.yaml` .

```bash
source ./env
./bin/pomerium -config config.yaml
```

## Navigate

Browse to `external-httpbin.your.domain.example`. Connections between you and [httpbin] will now be proxied and managed by Pomerium.
