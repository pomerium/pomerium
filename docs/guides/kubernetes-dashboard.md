# Securing Kubernetes Dashboard

The following guide covers how to secure [Kubernetes Dashboard] using Pomerium. Kubernetes Dashboard is a powerful, web-based UI for managing Kubernetes clusters. Pomerium can act as an independent **identity-aware access proxy** improving and adding single-sign-on to Kubernetes Dashboard's default access control. This is in contrast to most deployments, which use static tokens for access.

This tutorial covers:

- Deploying [Kubernetes Dashboard] using [Helm]
- Establishing secure Kubernetes Dashboard access through Pomerium

## Before You Begin

This guide builds off of existing articles and guides. It assumes you have deployed Pomerium to your cluster using our Helm charts, configured a certificate solution like [cert-manager], and set up secure access to the Kubernetes API. Follow the instructions in these pages before you continue:

- [Install Pomerium using Helm]
- [Securing Kubernetes]

## Background

Though securing [Kubernetes Dashboard] as an example may seem contrived, the damages caused by an unsecured dashboard is a real threat vector. In late 2018, Tesla [determined](https://redlock.io/blog/cryptojacking-tesla) that the hackers who were running [crypto-mining malware](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/02/tesla-cloud-resources-are-hacked-to-run-cryptocurrency-mining-malware/) on their cloud accounts came in through an unsecured [Kubernetes Dashboard] instance.

## Install Kubernetes Dashboard

[Kubernetes Dashboard] is a general purpose, web-based UI for Kubernetes clusters. It allows users to manage applications running in the cluster and troubleshoot them, as well as manage the cluster itself.

Use [Helm] to install a new instance of [Kubernetes Dashboard] :

```bash
helm repo add kubernetes-dashboard https://kubernetes.github.io/dashboard/
helm install kubernetes-dashboard kubernetes-dashboard/kubernetes-dashboard\
  --set ingress.enabled="false"
```

That's it. We've now configured the Kubernetes Dashboard in our cluster. We've also explicitly told Helm that we are going to deploy our own custom access to the service through Pomerium instead of a standard ingress.

## Add a Route

Following the configuration defined in [Install Pomerium using Helm], add a route for the Kubernetes Dashboard.

1. Modify `pomerium-values.yaml` with the following route:

    ```yaml
        - from: https://dashboard.localhost.pomerium.io
          to: https://kubernetes-dashboard.default.svc.cluster.local
          allow_spdy: true
          tls_skip_verify: true
          kubernetes_service_account_token_file: /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token
          policy:
            - allow:
                or:
                  - domain:
                      is: pomerium.com
    ```

    The service account token used for `kubernetes_service_account_token_file` is defined by our [helm chart]. Modify the policy to match your configuration.

1. Access to the dashboard for a user is authorized by the cluster role binding defined in role-based access control (**RBAC**) permissions. Following the [User Permissions] section of [Securing Kubernetes], you should already have permissions for your user, or you can create a new RBAC definition following this example (`rbac-someuser.yaml`):

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    kind: ClusterRoleBinding
    metadata:
      name: cluster-admin-crb
    roleRef:
      apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
      kind: ClusterRole
      name: cluster-admin
    subjects:
      - apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
        kind: User
        name: someuser@example.com
    ```

    Apply the permissions with `kubectl apply -f rbac-someuser.yaml`.

1. Apply the new route to Pomerium with Helm:

    ```bash
    helm upgrade --install pomerium pomerium/pomerium --values pomerium-values.yaml
    ```

## Conclusion

Because we've defined RBAC for our users, they can authenticate with Pomerium and Kubernetes will recognize that user in the Dashboard:
