# Community

## Get updates

[Pomerium-announce](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pomerium-announce) is is low traffic mailing list for important release and security announcements. We encourage all Pomerium users to subscribe to pomerium-announce.

On Twitter, we are [@pomerium_io](https://twitter.com/pomerium_io).

## Get help

If you have a question about using Pomerium, [join our slack channel](http://slack.pomerium.io/)! There will be more people there who can help you than just the Pomerium developers who follow our issue tracker. Issues are not the place for usage questions.

## Report bugs

Like every software, Pomerium has its flaws. If you find one, [search the issues](https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/issues) to see if it has already been reported. If not, [open a new issue](https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/issues/new) and describe the bug, and somebody will look into it!

Please follow the issue template so we have all the needed information. We need to be able to repeat the bug using your instructions. Please simplify the issue as much as possible. The more detailed and specific you are, the faster we will be able to help you!

We suggest reading [How to Report Bugs Effectively](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html).

## Suggest features

First, [search to see if your feature has already been requested](https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/issues). If it has, you can add a :+1: reaction to vote for it. If your feature idea is new, open an issue to request the feature. You don't have to follow the bug template for feature requests. Please describe your idea thoroughly so that we know how to implement it! Really vague requests may not be helpful or actionable and without clarification will have to be closed.

While we really do value your requests and implement many of them, not all features are a good fit for Pomerium. But if a feature is not in the best interest of the Pomerium project or its users in general, we may politely decline to implement it.
