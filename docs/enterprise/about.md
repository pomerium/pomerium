### Self-Service, and Access Controls

Easily define who can control access to what areas of your infrastructure. Our Namespaces make it easy to allow teams to self-manage access to the infrastructure they build from or depend on.

Pomerium Enterprise uses teams and groups defined by your IdP, so you can build stable policies that's don't need to be adjusted as your company changes.

### Deployment History & Audit Logs

View and export change and access logs from the web UI. Pomerium Enterprise Console gives you a complete view of who's using it and how access is adjusted.
