## Namespaces

A Namespace is a collection of users, groups, routes, and policies that allows system administrators to organize, manage, and delegate permissions across their infrastructure.

- Policies can be optional or enforced on a Namespace, and they can be nested to create inheritance.
- Users or groups can be granted permission to edit access to routes within a Namespace, allowing them self-serve access to the routes critical to their work.
