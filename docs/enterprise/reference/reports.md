## Events

The events page displays the log output of Envoy as it process changes from Pomerium and applies updates to the underlying services.

The most common updates are to Pomerium Proxy services, which are updated every time a Route or Policy is created or updated.

The value under **Resource ID** will usually match the resource ID of a [Policy][policy-reference], visible in the Policy under **Change History** or in the URL. A value of "Pomerium Restarted" refers to when services are reloaded, usually due to a system update.


## Deployments

From the **Deployment History** page administrators can review changes made to their Pomerium configuration.

The default view shows all changes made through Pomerium Enterprise. Use the **COMPARE** button next to an entry to filter to only changes that affected that resource. Select two versions of that resource, then **DIFF** to see what changed:
