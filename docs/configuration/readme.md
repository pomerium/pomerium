# Configuration Settings

Pomerium can be configured using a configuration file ([YAML]/[JSON]/[TOML]) or [environmental variables]. In general, environmental variable keys are identical to config file keys but are in uppercase. If you are coming from a kubernetes or docker background this should feel familiar. If not, check out the following primers.

- [Store config in the environment](https://12factor.net/config)
- [Kubernetes: Environment variables](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/define-environment-variable-container/)
- [Kubernetes: Config Maps](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-pod-configmap/)
- [Docker: Environment variables](https://docs.docker.com/compose/environment-variables/)

Using both [environmental variables] and config file keys is allowed and encouraged (for instance, secret keys are probably best set as environmental variables). However, if duplicate configuration keys are found, environment variables take precedence.

Pomerium will automatically reload the configuration file if it is changed. At this time, only policy is re-configured when this reload occurs, but additional options may be added in the future. It is suggested that your policy is stored in a configuration file so that you can take advantage of this feature.

## Shared Settings

These are configuration variables shared by all services, in all service modes.

### Service Mode

- Environmental Variable: `SERVICES`
- Config File Key: `services`
- Type: `string`
- Default: `all`
- Options: `all` `authenticate` `authorize` `cache` or `proxy`

Service mode sets the pomerium service(s) to run. If testing, you may want to set to `all` and run pomerium in "all-in-one mode." In production, you'll likely want to spin up several instances of each service mode for high availability.

### Address

- Environmental Variable: `ADDRESS`
- Config File Key: `address`
- Type: `string`
- Example: `:443`, `:8443`
- Default: `:443`
- Required

Address specifies the host and port to serve HTTP requests from. If empty, `:443` is used. Note, in all-in-one deployments, gRPC traffic will be served on loopback on port `:5443`.

### Administrators

- Environmental Variable: `ADMINISTRATORS`
- Config File Key: `administrators`
- Type: slice of `string`
- Example: `"admin@example.com,admin2@example.com"`

Administrative users are [super user](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superuser) that can sign in as another user or group. User impersonation allows administrators to temporarily impersonate a different user.

### Shared Secret

- Environmental Variable: `SHARED_SECRET`
- Config File Key: `shared_secret`
- Type: [base64 encoded] `string`
- Required

Shared Secret is the base64 encoded 256-bit key used to mutually authenticate requests between services. It's critical that secret keys are random, and stored safely. Use a key management system or `/dev/urandom/` to generate a key. For example:

```
head -c32 /dev/urandom | base64
```

### Debug

- Environmental Variable: `POMERIUM_DEBUG`
- Config File Key: `pomerium_debug`
- Type: `bool`
- Default: `false`

::: danger

Enabling the debug flag will result in sensitive information being logged!!!

:::

By default, JSON encoded logs are produced. Debug enables colored, human-readable logs to be streamed to [standard out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams#Standard_output_(stdout)>). In production, it's recommended to be set to `false`.

For example, if `true`

```
10:37AM INF cmd/pomerium version=v0.0.1-dirty+ede4124
10:37AM INF proxy: new route from=httpbin.corp.beyondperimeter.com to=https://httpbin.org
10:37AM INF proxy: new route from=ssl.corp.beyondperimeter.com to=http://neverssl.com
10:37AM INF proxy/authenticator: grpc connection OverrideCertificateName= addr=auth.corp.beyondperimeter.com:443
```

If `false`

```
{"level":"info","version":"v0.0.1-dirty+ede4124","time":"2019-02-18T10:41:03-08:00","message":"cmd/pomerium"}
{"level":"info","from":"httpbin.corp.beyondperimeter.com","to":"https://httpbin.org","time":"2019-02-18T10:41:03-08:00","message":"proxy: new route"}
{"level":"info","from":"ssl.corp.beyondperimeter.com","to":"http://neverssl.com","time":"2019-02-18T10:41:03-08:00","message":"proxy: new route"}
{"level":"info","OverrideCertificateName":"","addr":"auth.corp.beyondperimeter.com:443","time":"2019-02-18T10:41:03-08:00","message":"proxy/authenticator: grpc connection"}
```

### Log Level

- Environmental Variable: `LOG_LEVEL`
- Config File Key: `log_level`
- Type: `string`
- Options: `debug` `info` `warn` `error`
- Default: `debug`

Log level sets the global logging level for pomerium. Only logs of the desired level and above will be logged.

### Insecure Server

- Environmental Variable: `INSECURE_SERVER`
- Config File Key: `insecure_server`
- Type: `bool`
- Required if certificates unset

Turning on insecure server mode will result in pomerium starting, and operating without any protocol encryption in transit.

This setting can be useful in a situation where you have Pomerium behind a TLS terminating ingress or proxy. However, even in that case, it is highly recommended to use TLS to protect the confidentiality and integrity of service communication even behind the ingress using self-signed certificates or an internal CA. Please see our helm-chart for an example of just that.

:::warning

Pomerium should _never_ be exposed to the internet without TLS encryption.

:::

### Certificate

- Environmental Variable: either `CERTIFICATE` or `CERTIFICATE_FILE`
- Config File Key: `certificate` or `certificate_file`
- Type: [base64 encoded] `string` or relative file location
- Required

Certificate is the x509 _public-key_ used to establish secure HTTP and gRPC connections.

### Certificate Key

- Environmental Variable: either `CERTIFICATE_KEY` or `CERTIFICATE_KEY_FILE`
- Config File Key: `certificate_key` or `certificate_key_file`
- Type: [base64 encoded] `string`
- Required

Certificate key is the x509 _private-key_ used to establish secure HTTP and gRPC connections.

### Global Timeouts

- Environmental Variables: `TIMEOUT_READ` `TIMEOUT_WRITE` `TIMEOUT_READ_HEADER` `TIMEOUT_IDLE`
- Config File Key: `timeout_read` `timeout_write` `timeout_read_header` `timeout_idle`
- Type: [Go Duration](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Duration.String) `string`
- Example: `TIMEOUT_READ=30s`
- Defaults: `TIMEOUT_READ_HEADER=10s` `TIMEOUT_READ=30s` `TIMEOUT_WRITE=0` `TIMEOUT_IDLE=5m`

Timeouts set the global server timeouts. For route-specific timeouts, see [policy](./#policy).

![cloudflare blog on timeouts](https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2016/06/Timeouts-001.png)

> For a deep dive on timeout values see [these](https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-complete-guide-to-golang-net-http-timeouts/) [two](https://blog.cloudflare.com/exposing-go-on-the-internet/) excellent blog posts.

### GRPC Options

These settings control upstream connections to the Authorize service.

#### GRPC Address

- Environmental Variable: `GRPC_ADDRESS`
- Config File Key: `grpc_address`
- Type: `string`
- Example: `:443`, `:8443`
- Default: `:443` or `:5443` if in all-in-one mode

Address specifies the host and port to serve GRPC requests from. Defaults to `:443` (or `:5443` in all in one mode).

#### GRPC Insecure

- Environmental Variable: `GRPC_INSECURE`
- Config File Key: `grpc_insecure`
- Type: `bool`
- Default: `:443` (or `:5443` if in all-in-one mode)

If set, GRPC Insecure disables transport security for communication between the proxy and authorize components. If running in all-in-one mode, defaults to true as communication will run over localhost's own socket.

#### GRPC Client Timeout

Maximum time before canceling an upstream RPC request. During transient failures, the proxy will retry upstreams for this duration, if possible. You should leave this high enough to handle backend service restart and rediscovery so that client requests do not fail.

- Environmental Variable: `GRPC_CLIENT_TIMEOUT`
- Config File Key: `grpc_client_timeout`
- Type: [Go Duration](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Duration.String) `string`
- Default: `10s`

#### GRPC Client DNS RoundRobin

Enable grpc DNS based round robin load balancing. This method uses DNS to resolve endpoints and does client side load balancing of _all_ addresses returned by the DNS record. Do not disable unless you have a specific use case.

- Environmental Variable: `GRPC_CLIENT_DNS_ROUNDROBIN`
- Config File Key: `grpc_client_dns_roundrobin`
- Type: `bool`
- Default: `true`

#### GRPC Server Max Connection Age

Set max connection age for GRPC servers. After this interval, servers ask clients to reconnect and perform any rediscovery for new/updated endpoints from DNS.

See <https://godoc.org/google.golang.org/grpc/keepalive#ServerParameters> for details

- Environmental Variable: `GRPC_SERVER_MAX_CONNECTION_AGE`
- Config File Key: `grpc_server_max_connection_age`
- Type: [Go Duration](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Duration.String) `string`
- Default: `5m`

#### GRPC Server Max Connection Age Grace

Additive period with `grpc_server_max_connection_age`, after which servers will force connections to close.

See <https://godoc.org/google.golang.org/grpc/keepalive#ServerParameters> for details

- Environmental Variable: `GRPC_SERVER_MAX_CONNECTION_AGE_GRACE`
- Config File Key: `grpc_server_max_connection_age_grace`
- Type: [Go Duration](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Duration.String) `string`
- Default: `5m`

### Cookie options

These settings control the Pomerium session cookies sent to users's browsers.

#### Cookie name

- Environmental Variable: `COOKIE_NAME`
- Config File Key: `cookie_name`
- Type: `string`
- Default: `_pomerium`

The name of the session cookie sent to clients.

#### Cookie secret

- Environmental Variable: `COOKIE_SECRET`
- Config File Key: `cookie_secret`
- Type: [base64 encoded] `string`

Secret used to encrypt and sign session cookies. You can generate a random key with `head -c32 /dev/urandom | base64`.

#### Cookie domain

- Environmental Variable: `COOKIE_DOMAIN`
- Config File Key: `cookie_domain`
- Type: `string`
- Example: `corp.beyondperimeter.com`
- Optional

The scope of session cookies issued by Pomerium. Session cookies will be shared by all subdomains of the domain specified here.

#### HTTPS only

- Environmental Variable: `COOKIE_SECURE`
- Config File Key: `cookie_secure`
- Type: `bool`
- Default: `true`

If true, instructs browsers to only send user session cookies over HTTPS.

:::warning

Setting this to false may result in session cookies being sent in cleartext.

:::

#### Javascript security

- Environmental Variable: `COOKIE_HTTP_ONLY`
- Config File Key: `cookie_http_only`
- Type: `bool`
- Default: `true`

If true, prevents javascript in browsers from reading user session cookies.

:::warning

Setting this to false enables hostile javascript to steal session cookies and impersonate users.

:::

#### Expiration

- Environmental Variable: `COOKIE_EXPIRE`
- Config File Key: `cookie_expire`
- Type: [Go Duration](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Duration.String) `string`
- Default: `14h`

Sets the lifetime of session cookies. After this interval, users will be forced to go through the OAuth login flow again to get a new cookie.

### HTTP Redirect Address

- Environmental Variable: `HTTP_REDIRECT_ADDR`
- Config File Key: `http_redirect_addr`
- Type: `string`
- Example: `:80`, `:8080`
- Optional

If set, the HTTP Redirect Address specifies the host and port to redirect http to https traffic on. If unset, no redirect server is started.

### Metrics Address

- Environmental Variable: `METRICS_ADDRESS`
- Config File Key: `metrics_address`
- Type: `string`
- Example: `:9090`, `127.0.0.1:9090`
- Default: `disabled`
- Optional

Expose a prometheus format HTTP endpoint on the specified port. Disabled by default.

:::warning

**Use with caution:** the endpoint can expose frontend and backend server names or addresses. Do not externally expose the metrics if this is sensitive information.

### Tracing

Tracing tracks the progression of a single user request as it is handled by Pomerium.

Each unit work is called a Span in a trace. Spans include metadata about the work, including the time spent in the step (latency), status, time events, attributes, links. You can use tracing to debug errors and latency issues in your applications, including in downstream connections.

#### Shared Tracing Settings

Config Key       | Description                                                       | Required
:--------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------- | --------
tracing_provider | The name of the tracing provider. (e.g. jaeger)                   | ✅
tracing_debug    | Will disable [sampling](https://opencensus.io/tracing/sampling/). | ❌

#### Jaeger

[Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/) is a distributed tracing system released as open source by Uber Technologies. It is used for monitoring and troubleshooting microservices-based distributed systems, including:

- Distributed context propagation
- Distributed transaction monitoring
- Root cause analysis
- Service dependency analysis
- Performance / latency optimization

Config Key                        | Description                                 | Required
:-------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------ | --------
tracing_jaeger_collector_endpoint | Url to the Jaeger HTTP Thrift collector.    | ✅
tracing_jaeger_agent_endpoint     | Send spans to jaeger-agent at this address. | ✅

#### Example

![jaeger example trace](./img/jaeger.png) pomerium_config_last_reload_success_timestamp | Gauge | The timestamp of the last successful configuration reload by service pomerium_build_info | Gauge | Pomerium build metadata by git revision, service, version and goversion

### Forward Auth

- Environmental Variable: `FORWARD_AUTH_URL`
- Config File Key: `forward_auth_url`
- Type: `URL` (must contain a scheme and hostname)
- Example: `https://forwardauth.corp.example.com`
- Resulting Verification URL: `https://forwardauth.corp.example.com/?uri={URL-TO-VERIFY}`
- Optional

Forward authentication creates an endpoint that can be used with third-party proxies that do not have rich access control capabilities ([nginx](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_auth_request_module.html), [nginx-ingress](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/examples/auth/oauth-external-auth/), [ambassador](https://www.getambassador.io/reference/services/auth-service/), [traefik](https://docs.traefik.io/middlewares/forwardauth/)). Forward authentication allow you to delegate authentication and authorization for each request to Pomerium.

#### Request flow

![pomerium forward auth request flow](./img/auth-flow-diagram.svg)

#### Examples

##### NGINX Ingress

Some reverse-proxies, such as nginx split access control flow into two parts: verification and sign-in redirection. Notice the additional path `/verify` used for `auth-url` indicating to Pomerium that it should return a `401` instead of redirecting and starting the sign-in process.

```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: httpbin
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: "nginx"
    certmanager.k8s.io/issuer: "letsencrypt-prod"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-url: https://forwardauth.corp.example.com/verify?uri=$scheme://$host$request_uri
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-signin: "https://forwardauth.corp.example.com/?uri=$scheme://$host$request_uri"
spec:
  tls:
    - hosts:
        - httpbin.corp.example.com
      secretName: quickstart-example-tls
  rules:
    - host: httpbin.corp.example.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            backend:
              serviceName: httpbin
              servicePort: 80
```

#### Traefik docker-compose

```yml
version: "3"

```

## Authenticate Service

### Authenticate Service URL

- Environmental Variable: `AUTHENTICATE_SERVICE_URL`
- Config File Key: `authenticate_service_url`
- Type: `URL`
- Required
- Example: `https://authenticate.corp.example.com`

Authenticate Service URL is the externally accessible URL for the authenticate service.

### Identity Provider Name

- Environmental Variable: `IDP_PROVIDER`
- Config File Key: `idp_provider`
- Type: `string`
- Required
- Options: `azure` `google` `okta` `onelogin` or `oidc`

Provider is the short-hand name of a built-in OpenID Connect (oidc) identity provider to be used for authentication. To use a generic provider,set to `oidc`.

See [identity provider] for details.

### Identity Provider Client ID

- Environmental Variable: `IDP_CLIENT_ID`
- Config File Key: `idp_client_id`
- Type: `string`
- Required

Client ID is the OAuth 2.0 Client Identifier retrieved from your identity provider. See your identity provider's documentation, and our [identity provider] docs for details.

### Identity Provider Client Secret

- Environmental Variable: `IDP_CLIENT_SECRET`
- Config File Key: `idp_client_secret`
- Type: `string`
- Required

Client Secret is the OAuth 2.0 Secret Identifier retrieved from your identity provider. See your identity provider's documentation, and our [identity provider] docs for details.

### Identity Provider URL

- Environmental Variable: `IDP_PROVIDER_URL`
- Config File Key: `idp_provider_url`
- Type: `string`
- Required, depending on provider

Provider URL is the base path to an identity provider's [OpenID connect discovery document](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html). For example, google's URL would be `https://accounts.google.com` for [their discover document](https://accounts.google.com/.well-known/openid-configuration).

### Identity Provider Scopes

- Environmental Variable: `IDP_SCOPES`
- Config File Key: `idp_scopes`
- Type: `[]string` comma separated list of oauth scopes.
- Default: `oidc`,`profile`, `email`, `offline_access` (typically)
- Optional for built-in identity providers.

Identity provider scopes correspond to access privilege scopes as defined in Section 3.3 of OAuth 2.0 RFC6749\. The scopes associated with Access Tokens determine what resources will be available when they are used to access OAuth 2.0 protected endpoints. If you are using a built-in provider, you probably don't want to set customized scopes.

### Identity Provider Service Account

- Environmental Variable: `IDP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`
- Config File Key: `idp_service_account`
- Type: `string`
- Required, depending on provider

Identity Provider Service Account is field used to configure any additional user account or access-token that may be required for querying additional user information during authentication. For a concrete example, Google an additional service account and to make a follow-up request to query a user's group membership. For more information, refer to the [identity provider] docs to see if your provider requires this setting.

### Authenticate Callback Path

- Environmental Variable: `AUTHENTICATE_CALLBACK_PATH`
- Config File Key: `authenticate_callback_path`
- Type: `string`
- Default: `/oauth2/callback`
- Optional

The authenticate callback path is the path/url from the authenticate service that will receive the response from your identity provider. The value must exactly match one of the authorized redirect URIs for the OAuth 2.0 client.

This value is referred to as the `redirect_url` in the [OpenIDConnect][oidc rfc] and OAuth2 specs.

See also:

- [OAuth2 RFC 6749](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-3.1.2)
- [OIDC Spec][oidc rfc]
- [Google - Setting Redirect URI](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OpenIDConnect#setredirecturi)

## Proxy Service

### Authenticate Service URL

- Environmental Variable: `AUTHENTICATE_SERVICE_URL`
- Config File Key: `authenticate_service_url`
- Type: `URL`
- Required
- Example: `https://authenticate.corp.example.com`

Authenticate Service URL is the externally accessible URL for the authenticate service.

### Authorize Service URL

- Environmental Variable: `AUTHORIZE_SERVICE_URL`
- Config File Key: `authorize_service_url`
- Type: `URL`
- Required; inferred in all-in-one mode to be localhost.
- Example: `https://pomerium-authorize-service.default.svc.cluster.local` or `https://localhost:5443`

Authorize Service URL is the location of the internally accessible authorize service. NOTE: Unlike authenticate, authorize has no publicly accessible http handlers so this setting is purely for gRPC communication.

If your load balancer does not support gRPC pass-through you'll need to set this value to an internally routable location (`https://pomerium-authorize-service.default.svc.cluster.local`) instead of an externally routable one (`https://authorize.corp.example.com`).

### Override Certificate Name

- Environmental Variable: `OVERRIDE_CERTIFICATE_NAME`
- Config File Key: `override_certificate_name`
- Type: `int`
- Optional
- Example: `*.corp.example.com` if wild card or `authenticate.corp.example.com`/`authorize.corp.example.com`

Secure service communication can fail if the external certificate does not match the internally routed service hostname/[SNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication). This setting allows you to override that value.

### Certificate Authority

- Environmental Variable: `CERTIFICATE_AUTHORITY` or `CERTIFICATE_AUTHORITY_FILE`
- Config File Key: `certificate_authority` or `certificate_authority_file`
- Type: [base64 encoded] `string` or relative file location
- Optional

Certificate Authority is set when behind-the-ingress service communication uses self-signed certificates. Be sure to include the intermediary certificate.

### Headers

- Environmental Variable: `HEADERS`
- Config File Key: `headers`
- Type: map of `strings` key value pairs
- Examples:

  - Comma Separated: `X-Content-Type-Options:nosniff,X-Frame-Options:SAMEORIGIN`
  - JSON: `'{"X-Test": "X-Value"}'`
  - YAML:

    ```yaml
    headers:
      X-Test: X-Value
    ```

- To disable: `disable:true`

- Default :

  ```javascript
  X-Content-Type-Options : nosniff,
  X-Frame-Options:SAMEORIGIN,
  X-XSS-Protection:1; mode=block,
  Strict-Transport-Security:max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload,
  ```

Headers specifies a mapping of [HTTP Header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers) to be added to proxied requests. _Nota bene_ Downstream application headers will be overwritten by Pomerium's headers on conflict.

By default, conservative [secure HTTP headers](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Secure_Headers_Project) are set.

### Refresh Cooldown

- Environmental Variable: `REFRESH_COOLDOWN`
- Config File Key: `refresh_cooldown`
- Type: [Duration](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Duration) `string`
- Example: `10m`, `1h45m`
- Default: `5m`

Refresh cooldown is the minimum amount of time between allowed manually refreshed sessions.

### Default Upstream Timeout

- Environmental Variable: `DEFAULT_UPSTREAM_TIMEOUT`
- Config File Key: `default_upstream_timeout`
- Type: [Duration](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Duration) `string`
- Example: `10m`, `1h45m`
- Default: `30s`

Default Upstream Timeout is the default timeout applied to a proxied route when no `timeout` key is specified by the policy.

### JWT Claim Headers

- Environmental Variable: `JWT_CLAIMS_HEADERS`
- Config File Key: `jwt_claims_headers`
- Type: slice of `string`
- Example: `email`,`groups`, `user`
- Optional

The JWT Claim Headers setting allows you to pass specific user session data down to downstream applications as HTTP request headers. Note, unlike the header `x-pomerium-jwt-assertion` these values are not signed by the authorization service.

Any claim in the pomerium session JWT can be placed into a corresponding header for downstream consumption. This claim information is sourced from your Identity Provider (IdP) and Pomerium's own session metadata.

Use this option if you previously relied on `x-pomerium-authenticated-user-{email|user-id|groups}` for downstream authN/Z.

## Cache Service

The cache service is used for storing user session data.

### Cache Store

- Environmental Variable: `CACHE_STORE`
- Config File Key: `cache_store`
- Type: `string`
- Default: `autocache`
- Options: `autocache` `bolt` or `redis`. Other contributions are welcome.

CacheStore is the name of session cache backend to use.

### Autocache

[Autocache](https://github.com/pomerium/autocache) is the default session store. Autocache is based off of distributed version of [memecached](https://memcached.org/), called [groupcache](https://github.com/golang/groupcache) made by Google and used by many organizations like Twitter and Vimeo in production. Autocache is suitable for both small deployments, where it acts as a embedded cache, or larger scale, distributed installs.

When deployed in a distributed fashion, autocache uses [gossip](https://github.com/hashicorp/memberlist) based membership to manage its peers.

Autocache does not require any additional settings but does require that the cache url setting returns name records that correspond to a [list of peers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#headless-services).

### [Redis](https://redis.io/)

Redis, when used as a [LRU cache](https://redis.io/topics/lru-cache), functions in a very similar way to autocache. Redis store support allows you to leverage existing infrastructure, and to persist session data if that is a requirement.

#### Redis Address

- Environmental Variable: `CACHE_STORE_ADDRESS`
- Config File Key: `cache_store_address`
- Type: `string`
- Example: `localhost:6379`

CacheStoreAddr specifies the host and port on which the cache store should connect to redis.

#### Redis Password

- Environmental Variable: `CACHE_STORE_PASSWORD`
- Config File Key: `cache_store_password`
- Type: `string`

CacheStoreAddr is the password used to connect to redis.

### [Bolt](https://godoc.org/go.etcd.io/bbolt/)

Bolt is a simple, lightweight, low level key value store and is the underlying storage mechanism in projects like [etcd](https://etcd.io/). Bolt persists data to a file, and has no built in eviction mechanism.

Bolt is suitable for all-in-one deployments that do not require concurrent / distributed writes.

#### Bolt Path

- Environmental Variable: `CACHE_STORE_PATH`
- Config File Key: `cache_store_path`
- Type: `string`
- Example: `/etc/bolt.db`

CacheStorePath is the path to save bolt's database file.

## Policy

- Environmental Variable: `POLICY`
- Config File Key: `policy`
- Type: [base64 encoded] `string` or inline policy structure in config file
- **Required** However, pomerium will safely start without a policy configured, but will be unable to authorize or proxy traffic until the configuration is updated to contain a policy.

Policy contains route specific settings, and access control details. If you are configuring via POLICY environment variable, just the contents of the policy needs to be passed. If you are configuring via file, the policy should be present under the policy key. For example,

<<< @/docs/configuration/examples/config/policy.example.yaml

Policy routes are checked in the order they appear in the policy, so more specific routes should appear before less specific routes. For example:

```yaml
policies:
  - from: http://from.example.com
    to: http://to.example.com
    prefix: /admin
    allowed_groups: ["superuser"]
  - from: http://from.example.com
    to: http://to.example.com
    allow_public_unauthenticated_access: true
```

In this example an incoming request with a path prefix of `/admin` would be handled by the first route (which is restricted to superusers). All other requests for `from.example.com` would be handled by the second route (which is open to the public).

A list of policy configuration variables follows.

### From

- `yaml`/`json` setting: `from`
- Type: `URL` (must contain a scheme and hostname, must not contain a path)
- Required
- Example: `https://httpbin.corp.example.com`

`From` is externally accessible source of the proxied request.

### To

- `yaml`/`json` setting: `to`
- Type: `URL` (must contain a scheme and hostname)
- Required
- Example: `http://httpbin` , `https://192.1.20.12:8080`, `http://neverssl.com`

`To` is the destination of a proxied request. It can be an internal resource, or an external resource.

### Prefix

- `yaml`/`json` setting: `prefix`
- Type: `string`
- Optional
- Example: `/admin`

If set, the route will only match incoming requests with a path that begins with the specified prefix.

### Path

- `yaml`/`json` setting: `path`
- Type: `string`
- Optional
- Example: `/admin/some/exact/path`

If set, the route will only match incoming requests with a path that is an exact match for the specified path.

### Regex

- `yaml`/`json` setting: `regex`
- Type: `string` (containing a regular expression)
- Optional
- Example: `^/(admin|superuser)/.*$`

If set, the route will only match incoming requests with a path that matches the specified regular expression. The supported syntax is the same as the Go [regexp package](https://golang.org/pkg/regexp/) which is based on [re2](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax).

### Allowed Users

- `yaml`/`json` setting: `allowed_users`
- Type: collection of `strings`
- Required
- Example: `alice@pomerium.io` , `bob@contractor.co`

Allowed users is a collection of whitelisted users to authorize for a given route.

### Allowed Groups

- `yaml`/`json` setting: `allowed_groups`
- Type: collection of `strings`
- Required
- Example: `admins` , `support@company.com`

Allowed groups is a collection of whitelisted groups to authorize for a given route.

### Allowed Domains

- `yaml`/`json` setting: `allowed_domains`
- Type: collection of `strings`
- Required
- Example: `pomerium.io` , `gmail.com`

Allowed domains is a collection of whitelisted domains to authorize for a given route.

### CORS Preflight

- `yaml`/`json` setting: `cors_allow_preflight`
- Type: `bool`
- Optional
- Default: `false`

Allow unauthenticated HTTP OPTIONS requests as [per the CORS spec](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#Preflighted_requests).

### Public Access

- `yaml`/`json` setting: `allow_public_unauthenticated_access`
- Type: `bool`
- Optional
- Default: `false`

**Use with caution:** Allow all requests for a given route, bypassing authentication and authorization. Suitable for publicly exposed web services.

If this setting is enabled, no whitelists (e.g. Allowed Users) should be provided in this route.

### Route Timeout

- `yaml`/`json` setting: `timeout`
- Type: [Go Duration](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Duration.String) `string`
- Optional
- Default: `30s`

Policy timeout establishes the per-route timeout value. Cannot exceed global timeout values.

### Websocket Connections

- Config File Key: `allow_websockets`
- Type: `bool`
- Default: `false`

If set, enables proxying of websocket connections.

**Use with caution:** By definition, websockets are long-lived connections, so [global timeouts](#global-timeouts) are not enforced. Allowing websocket connections to the proxy could result in abuse via [DOS attacks](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/ddos-attack-tools/slowloris/).

### TLS Skip Verification

- Config File Key: `tls_skip_verify`
- Type: `bool`
- Default: `false`

TLS Skip Verification controls whether a client verifies the server's certificate chain and host name. If enabled, TLS accepts any certificate presented by the server and any host name in that certificate. In this mode, TLS is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks. This should be used only for testing.

### TLS Server Name

- Config File Key: `tls_server_name`
- Type: `string`
- Optional

TLS Server Name overrides the hostname you specified in the `to` field. If set, this server name will be used to verify server side certificate. This is useful when the backend of your service is an HTTPS server with valid certificate, but you want to communicate via an internal hostname or IP address.

### TLS Custom Certificate Authority

- Config File Key: `tls_custom_ca` or `tls_custom_ca_file`
- Type: [base64 encoded] `string` or relative file location
- Optional

TLS Custom Certificate Authority defines the set of root certificate authorities that clients use when verifying server certificates.

Note: This setting will replace (not append) the system's trust store for a given route.

### TLS Client Certificate

- Config File Key: `tls_client_cert` and `tls_client_key` or `tls_client_cert_file` and `tls_client_key_file`
- Type: [base64 encoded] `string` or relative file location
- Optional

Pomerium supports client certificates which can be used to enforce [mutually authenticated and encrypted TLS connections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_authentication) (mTLS). For more details, see our [mTLS example repository](https://github.com/pomerium/examples/tree/master/mutual-tls) and the [certificate docs](./certificates.md).

### Set Request Headers

- Config File Key: `set_request_headers`
- Type: map of `strings` key value pairs
- Optional

Set Request Headers allows you to set static values for given request headers. This can be useful if you want to pass along additional information to downstream applications as headers, or set authentication header to the request. For example:

```yaml
- from: https://httpbin.corp.example.com
  to: https://httpbin.org
  allowed_users:
    - bdd@pomerium.io
  set_request_headers:
    # works auto-magically!
    # https://httpbin.corp.example.com/basic-auth/root/hunter42
    Authorization: Basic cm9vdDpodW50ZXI0Mg==
    X-Your-favorite-authenticating-Proxy: "Pomerium"
```

### Preserve Host Header

- `yaml`/`json` setting: `preserve_host_header`
- Type: `bool`
- Optional
- Default: `false`

When enabled, this option will pass the host header from the incoming request to the proxied host, instead of the destination hostname.

See [ProxyPreserveHost](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_proxy.html#proxypreservehost).

## Authorize Service

### Signing Key

- Environmental Variable: `SIGNING_KEY`
- Config File Key: `signing_key`
- Type: [base64 encoded] `string`
- Optional

Signing key is the base64 encoded key used to sign outbound requests. For more information see the [signed headers](./signed-headers.md) docs.

If no certificate is specified, one will be generated for you and the base64'd public key will be added to the logs.
