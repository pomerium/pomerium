# Kubernetes

This quickstart will show you how to deploy Pomerium with Kubernetes. Though there are [countless ways](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/pick-right-solution/) to work with Kubernetes, for the purpose of this guide, we will be using Google's [Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/). That said, most of the following steps should be very similar using any other provider.

## Prerequisites

- A [Google Cloud Account](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
- A configured [identity provider]
- Install [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
- Install the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/quickstart)

## Download

Retrieve the latest copy of pomerium's source-code by cloning the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium.git $HOME/pomerium
```

## Configure

Edit [./scripts/kubernetes_gke.sh] making sure to change the identity provider secret value to match your [identity provider] settings.

Place your domain's wild-card TLS certificate (`privkey.pem` and `cert.pem`) in the root of the repository. If you don't have one handy, the included [script] generates one from [LetsEncrypt].

## Run

Run [./scripts/kubernetes_gke.sh] which will:

1. Provision a new cluster
2. Create authenticate, authorize, and proxy [deployments](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/deployment).
3. Provision and apply authenticate, authorize, and proxy [services](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/service).
4. Configure an ingress load balancer.

```bash
sh ./scripts/kubernetes_gke.sh
```

You should see roughly the following in your terminal. Note, provisioning does take a few minutes.

And if you check out Google's Kubernetes Engine dashboard you'll see something like:

## Navigate

Open a browser and navigate to `httpbin.your.domain.com`.

You should see something like the following in your browser.
