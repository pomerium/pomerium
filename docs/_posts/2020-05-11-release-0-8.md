# Announcing Pomerium 0.8

We are excited to announce the [0.8 release] of Pomerium which adds support for some of our most requested features including:

- [**Automatic Certificate Management**] — Pomerium can now be configured to automatically retrieve and renew certificates, adding HTTPS to all Pomerium managed routes. In addition, Pomerium will do [OCSP stapling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCSP_stapling) for automatic and custom certificates alike.
- [**Advanced Route Matching**] — Operators can now write access policy that supports route matching based on [regex], [prefix], and [path] settings. Pomerium now has the flexibility to support multiple and layered authorization policies across a single managed route.
- And finally, this release adds [**Github**](https://github.com/) as a supported identity provider.

Pomerium had 95 commits from 8 authors across 5 organizations in this release. This release also includes additional new features, general improvements, and bug fixes, a complete list of which can be found in the [changelog].

As always, we recommend upgrading and testing this release in an isolated environment. If you experience any issues, please report them on the Pomerium GitHub [issue tracker].
