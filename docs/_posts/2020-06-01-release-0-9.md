# Announcing Pomerium 0.9

We are excited to announce the [0.9 release](https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/releases/tag/v0.9.0) of Pomerium which includes a complete refactor of the proxy service and several security-enhancing features. Those features include:

- [Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/)-based data plane — Pomerium now leverages Envoy for request proxying rather than the previous custom-built proxy. This change gives operators confidence that Pomerium will be able to handle any workload.
- [Client Certificate Support](https://www.pomerium.io/configuration/#tls-client-certificate) — A [core principle](https://www.pomerium.io/docs/background.html#zero-trust-security-behind-the-gates) of the zero-trust security model is that every request should be not only authenticated and authorized, but also mutually authenticated and encrypted. With this release, Pomerium adds support for [mutually authenticated encryption](https://www.pomerium.io/recipes/mtls.html) (mTLS) starting with the user's device itself.
- [JWKS Endpoint](https://www.pomerium.io/configuration/#signing-key) — Pomerium now surfaces a JWKS endpoint that can be used by upstream applications as well as other services such as [Istio](https://www.pomerium.io/configuration/examples.html#istio) to [verify](https://www.pomerium.io/docs/reference/getting-users-identity.html#verification) the authenticity of a Pomerium managed request.

Pomerium had 99 commits from 9 authors across 6 organizations [in this release](https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/releases/tag/v0.9.0). This release also includes additional new features, general improvements, and bug fixes, a complete list of which can be found in the [changelog](https://www.pomerium.io/docs/CHANGELOG.html).

As always, we recommend upgrading and testing this release in an isolated environment. If you experience any issues, please report them on the Pomerium GitHub [issue tracker](https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/issues).
