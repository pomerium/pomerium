The Model Context Protocol (MCP) follows a client-host-server architecture where each
host can run multiple client instances. This architecture enables users to integrate AI
capabilities across applications while maintaining clear security boundaries and
isolating concerns. Built on JSON-RPC, MCP provides a stateful session protocol focused
on context exchange and sampling coordination between clients and servers.

## Core Components

```mermaid

    subgraph "Application Host Process"
        H[Host]
        C1[Client 1]
        C2[Client 2]
        C3[Client 3]
        H --> C1
        H --> C2
        H --> C3
    end

    subgraph "Local machine"
        S1[Server 1<br>Files & Git]
        S2[Server 2<br>Database]
        R1[("Local<br>Resource A")]
        R2[("Local<br>Resource B")]

        C1 --> S1
        C2 --> S2
        S1 <--> R1
        S2 <--> R2
    end

    subgraph "Internet"
        S3[Server 3<br>External APIs]
        R3[("Remote<br>Resource C")]

        C3 --> S3
        S3 <--> R3
    end
```

### Host

The host process acts as the container and coordinator:

- Creates and manages multiple client instances
- Controls client connection permissions and lifecycle
- Enforces security policies and consent requirements
- Handles user authorization decisions
- Coordinates AI/LLM integration and sampling
- Manages context aggregation across clients

### Clients

Each client is created by the host and maintains an isolated server connection:

- Establishes one stateful session per server
- Handles protocol negotiation and capability exchange
- Routes protocol messages bidirectionally
- Manages subscriptions and notifications
- Maintains security boundaries between servers

A host application creates and manages multiple clients, with each client having a 1:1
relationship with a particular server.

### Servers

Servers provide specialized context and capabilities:

- Expose resources, tools and prompts via MCP primitives
- Operate independently with focused responsibilities
- Request sampling through client interfaces
- Must respect security constraints
- Can be local processes or remote services

## Design Principles

MCP is built on several key design principles that inform its architecture and
implementation:

1. **Servers should be extremely easy to build**
   - Host applications handle complex orchestration responsibilities
   - Servers focus on specific, well-defined capabilities
   - Simple interfaces minimize implementation overhead
   - Clear separation enables maintainable code

2. **Servers should be highly composable**
   - Each server provides focused functionality in isolation
   - Multiple servers can be combined seamlessly
   - Shared protocol enables interoperability
   - Modular design supports extensibility

3. **Servers should not be able to read the whole conversation, nor "see into" other
   servers**
   - Servers receive only necessary contextual information
   - Full conversation history stays with the host
   - Each server connection maintains isolation
   - Cross-server interactions are controlled by the host
   - Host process enforces security boundaries

4. **Features can be added to servers and clients progressively**
   - Core protocol provides minimal required functionality
   - Additional capabilities can be negotiated as needed
   - Servers and clients evolve independently
   - Protocol designed for future extensibility
   - Backwards compatibility is maintained

## Capability Negotiation

The Model Context Protocol uses a capability-based negotiation system where clients and
servers explicitly declare their supported features during initialization. Capabilities
determine which protocol features and primitives are available during a session.

- Servers declare capabilities like resource subscriptions, tool support, and prompt
  templates
- Clients declare capabilities like sampling support and notification handling
- Both parties must respect declared capabilities throughout the session
- Additional capabilities can be negotiated through extensions to the protocol

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Host
    participant Client
    participant Server

    Host->>+Client: Initialize client
    Client->>+Server: Initialize session with capabilities
    Server-->>Client: Respond with supported capabilities

    Note over Host,Server: Active Session with Negotiated Features

    loop Client Requests
        Host->>Client: User- or model-initiated action
        Client->>Server: Request (tools/resources)
        Server-->>Client: Response
        Client-->>Host: Update UI or respond to model
    end

    loop Server Requests
        Server->>Client: Request (sampling)
        Client->>Host: Forward to AI
        Host-->>Client: AI response
        Client-->>Server: Response
    end

    loop Notifications
        Server--)Client: Resource updates
        Client--)Server: Status changes
    end

    Host->>Client: Terminate
    Client->>-Server: End session
    deactivate Server
```

Each capability unlocks specific protocol features for use during the session. For
example:

- Implemented [server features](/specification/2025-11-25/server) must be advertised in the
  server's capabilities
- Emitting resource subscription notifications requires the server to declare
  subscription support
- Tool invocation requires the server to declare tool capabilities
- [Sampling](/specification/2025-11-25/client) requires the client to declare support in its
  capabilities

This capability negotiation ensures clients and servers have a clear understanding of
supported functionality while maintaining protocol extensibility.
