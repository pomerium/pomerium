## Introduction

### Purpose and Scope

The Model Context Protocol provides authorization capabilities at the transport level,
enabling MCP clients to make requests to restricted MCP servers on behalf of resource
owners. This specification defines the authorization flow for HTTP-based transports.

### Protocol Requirements

Authorization is **OPTIONAL** for MCP implementations. When supported:

- Implementations using an HTTP-based transport **SHOULD** conform to this specification.
- Implementations using an STDIO transport **SHOULD NOT** follow this specification, and
  instead retrieve credentials from the environment.
- Implementations using alternative transports **MUST** follow established security best
  practices for their protocol.

### Standards Compliance

This authorization mechanism is based on established specifications listed below, but
implements a selected subset of their features to ensure security and interoperability
while maintaining simplicity:

- OAuth 2.1 IETF DRAFT ([draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13))
- OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata
  ([RFC8414](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8414))
- OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol
  ([RFC7591](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7591))
- OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata ([RFC9728](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728))
- OAuth Client ID Metadata Documents ([draft-ietf-oauth-client-id-metadata-document-00](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-client-id-metadata-document-00))

## Roles

A protected _MCP server_ acts as an [OAuth 2.1 resource server](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13.html#name-roles),
capable of accepting and responding to protected resource requests using access tokens.

An _MCP client_ acts as an [OAuth 2.1 client](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13.html#name-roles),
making protected resource requests on behalf of a resource owner.

The _authorization server_ is responsible for interacting with the user (if necessary) and issuing access tokens for use at the MCP server.
The implementation details of the authorization server are beyond the scope of this specification. It may be hosted with the
resource server or a separate entity. The [Authorization Server Discovery section](#authorization-server-discovery)
specifies how an MCP server indicates the location of its corresponding authorization server to a client.

## Overview

1. Authorization servers **MUST** implement OAuth 2.1 with appropriate security
   measures for both confidential and public clients.

2. Authorization servers and MCP clients **SHOULD** support OAuth Client ID Metadata Documents
   ([draft-ietf-oauth-client-id-metadata-document-00](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-client-id-metadata-document-00)).

3. Authorization servers and MCP clients **MAY** support the OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration
   Protocol ([RFC7591](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7591)).

4. MCP servers **MUST** implement OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata ([RFC9728](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728)).
   MCP clients **MUST** use OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata for authorization server discovery.

5. MCP authorization servers **MUST** provide at least one of the following discovery mechanisms:
   - OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata ([RFC8414](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8414))
   - [OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html)

   MCP clients **MUST** support both discovery mechanisms to obtain the information required to interact with the authorization server.

## Authorization Server Discovery

This section describes the mechanisms by which MCP servers advertise their associated
authorization servers to MCP clients, as well as the discovery process through which MCP
clients can determine authorization server endpoints and supported capabilities.

### Authorization Server Location

MCP servers **MUST** implement the OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata ([RFC9728](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728))
specification to indicate the locations of authorization servers. The Protected Resource Metadata document returned by the MCP server **MUST** include
the `authorization_servers` field containing at least one authorization server.

The specific use of `authorization_servers` is beyond the scope of this specification; implementers should consult
OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata ([RFC9728](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728)) for
guidance on implementation details.

Implementors should note that Protected Resource Metadata documents can define multiple authorization servers. The responsibility for selecting which authorization server to use lies with the MCP client, following the guidelines specified in
[RFC9728 Section 7.6 "Authorization Servers"](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728#name-authorization-servers).

### Protected Resource Metadata Discovery Requirements

MCP servers **MUST** implement one of the following discovery mechanisms to provide authorization server location information to MCP clients:

1. **WWW-Authenticate Header**: Include the resource metadata URL in the `WWW-Authenticate` HTTP header under `resource_metadata` when returning `401 Unauthorized` responses, as described in [RFC9728 Section 5.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728#name-www-authenticate-response).

2. **Well-Known URI**: Serve metadata at a well-known URI as specified in [RFC9728](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728). This can be either:
   - At the path of the server's MCP endpoint: `https://example.com/public/mcp` could host metadata at `https://example.com/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/public/mcp`
   - At the root: `https://example.com/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`

MCP clients **MUST** support both discovery mechanisms and use the resource metadata URL from the parsed `WWW-Authenticate` headers when present; otherwise, they **MUST** fall back to constructing and requesting the well-known URIs in the order listed above.

MCP servers **SHOULD** include a `scope` parameter in the `WWW-Authenticate` header as defined in
[RFC 6750 Section 3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750#section-3)
to indicate the scopes required for accessing the resource. This provides clients with immediate
guidance on the appropriate scopes to request during authorization,
following the principle of least privilege and preventing clients from requesting excessive permissions.

The scopes included in the `WWW-Authenticate` challenge **MAY** match `scopes_supported`, be a subset
or superset of it, or an alternative collection that is neither a strict subset nor
superset. Clients **MUST NOT** assume any particular set relationship between the challenged
scope set and `scopes_supported`. Clients **MUST** treat the scopes provided in the
challenge as authoritative for satisfying the current request. Servers **SHOULD** strive for
consistency in how they construct scope sets but they are not required to surface every dynamically
issued scope through `scopes_supported`.

Example 401 response with scope guidance:

```http
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
WWW-Authenticate: Bearer resource_metadata="https://mcp.example.com/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource",
                         scope="files:read"
```

MCP clients **MUST** be able to parse `WWW-Authenticate` headers and respond appropriately to `HTTP 401 Unauthorized` responses from the MCP server.

If the `scope` parameter is absent, clients **SHOULD** apply the fallback behavior defined in the [Scope Selection Strategy](#scope-selection-strategy) section.

### Authorization Server Metadata Discovery

To handle different issuer URL formats and ensure interoperability with both OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata and OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0 specifications, MCP clients **MUST** attempt multiple well-known endpoints when discovering authorization server metadata.

The discovery approach is based on [RFC8414 Section 3.1 "Authorization Server Metadata Request"](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8414#section-3.1) for OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata discovery and [RFC8414 Section 5 "Compatibility Notes"](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8414#section-5) for OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0 interoperability.

For issuer URLs with path components (e.g., `https://auth.example.com/tenant1`), clients **MUST** try endpoints in the following priority order:

1. OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata with path insertion: `https://auth.example.com/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server/tenant1`
2. OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0 with path insertion: `https://auth.example.com/.well-known/openid-configuration/tenant1`
3. OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0 path appending: `https://auth.example.com/tenant1/.well-known/openid-configuration`

For issuer URLs without path components (e.g., `https://auth.example.com`), clients **MUST** try:

1. OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata: `https://auth.example.com/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`
2. OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0: `https://auth.example.com/.well-known/openid-configuration`

### Authorization Server Discovery Sequence Diagram

The following diagram outlines an example flow:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant M as MCP Server (Resource Server)
    participant A as Authorization Server

    Note over C: Attempt unauthenticated MCP request
    C->>M: MCP request without token
    M-->>C: HTTP 401 Unauthorized (may include WWW-Authenticate header)

    alt Header includes resource_metadata
        Note over C: Extract resource_metadata URL from header
        C->>M: GET resource_metadata URI
        M-->>C: Resource metadata with authorization server URL
    else No resource_metadata in header
        Note over C: Fallback to well-known URI probing
        Note over M: _Not applicable if the MCP server is at the root_
        C->>M: GET /.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp

            else Root metadata not found
                Note over C: Abort or use pre-configured values
            end
        end
    end

    A-->>C: Access token

    C->>M: MCP request with access token
    M-->>C: MCP response
    Note over C,M: MCP communication continues with valid token
```

## Client Registration Approaches

MCP supports three client registration mechanisms. Choose based on your scenario:

- **Client ID Metadata Documents**: When client and server have no prior relationship (most common)
- **Pre-registration**: When client and server have an existing relationship
- **Dynamic Client Registration**: For backwards compatibility or specific requirements

Clients supporting all options **SHOULD** follow the following priority order:

1. Use pre-registered client information for the server if the client has it available
2. Use Client ID Metadata Documents if the Authorization Server indicates if the server supports it (via `client_id_metadata_document_supported` in OAuth Authorization Server Metadata)
3. Use Dynamic Client Registration as a fallback if the Authorization Server supports it (via `registration_endpoint` in OAuth Authorization Server Metadata)
4. Prompt the user to enter the client information if no other option is available

### Client ID Metadata Documents

MCP clients and authorization servers **SHOULD** support OAuth Client ID Metadata Documents as specified in
[OAuth Client ID Metadata Document](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-client-id-metadata-document-00).
This approach enables clients to use HTTPS URLs as client identifiers, where the URL points to a JSON document
containing client metadata. This addresses the common MCP scenario where servers and clients have
no pre-existing relationship.

#### Implementation Requirements

MCP implementations supporting Client ID Metadata Documents **MUST** follow the requirements specified in
[OAuth Client ID Metadata Document](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-client-id-metadata-document-00).
Key requirements include:

**For MCP Clients:**

- Clients **MUST** host their metadata document at an HTTPS URL following RFC requirements
- The `client_id` URL **MUST** use the "https" scheme and contain a path component, e.g. `https://example.com/client.json`
- The metadata document **MUST** include at least the following properties: `client_id`, `client_name`, `redirect_uris`
- Clients **MUST** ensure the `client_id` value in the metadata matches the document URL exactly
- Clients **MAY** use `private_key_jwt` for client authentication (e.g., for requests to the token endpoint) with appropriate JWKS configuration as described in [Section 6.2 of Client ID Metadata Document](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-client-id-metadata-document-00.html#section-6.2)

**For Authorization Servers:**

- **SHOULD** fetch metadata documents when encountering URL-formatted client_ids
- **MUST** validate that the fetched document's `client_id` matches the URL exactly
- **SHOULD** cache metadata respecting HTTP cache headers
- **MUST** validate redirect URIs presented in an authorization request against those in the metadata document
- **MUST** validate the document structure is valid JSON and contains required fields
- **SHOULD** follow the security considerations in [Section 6 of Client ID Metadata Document](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-client-id-metadata-document-00.html#section-6)

#### Example Metadata Document

```json
{
  "client_id": "https://app.example.com/oauth/client-metadata.json",
  "client_name": "Example MCP Client",
  "client_uri": "https://app.example.com",
  "logo_uri": "https://app.example.com/logo.png",
  "redirect_uris": [
    "http://127.0.0.1:3000/callback",
    "http://localhost:3000/callback"
  ],
  "grant_types": ["authorization_code"],
  "response_types": ["code"],
  "token_endpoint_auth_method": "none"
}
```

#### Client ID Metadata Documents Flow

The following diagram illustrates the complete flow when using Client ID Metadata Documents:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Client as MCP Client
    participant Server as Authorization Server
    participant Metadata as Metadata Endpoint<br/>(Client's HTTPS URL)
    participant Resource as MCP Server

    Note over Client,Metadata: Client hosts metadata at<br/>https://app.example.com/oauth/metadata.json

    User->>Client: Initiates connection to MCP Server
    Client->>Server: Authorization Request<br/>client_id=https://app.example.com/oauth/metadata.json<br/>redirect_uri=http://localhost:3000/callback

    Server->>User: Authentication prompt
    User->>Server: Provides credentials
    Note over Server: Authenticates user

    Note over Server: Detects URL-formatted client_id

    Server->>Metadata: GET https://app.example.com/oauth/metadata.json
    Metadata-->>Server: JSON Metadata Document<br/>{client_id, client_name, redirect_uris, ...}

    Note over Server: Validates:<br/>1. client_id matches URL<br/>2. redirect_uri in allowed list<br/>3. Document structure valid<br/>4. (Optional) Domain allowed via trust policy

    alt Validation Success
        Server->>User: Display consent page with client_name
        User->>Server: Approves access
        Server->>Client: Authorization code via redirect_uri
        Client->>Server: Exchange code for token<br/>client_id=https://app.example.com/oauth/metadata.json
        Server-->>Client: Access token
        Client->>Resource: MCP requests with access token
        Resource-->>Client: MCP responses
    else Validation Failure
        Server->>User: Error response<br/>error=invalid_client or invalid_request
    end

    Note over Server: Cache metadata for future requests<br/>(respecting HTTP cache headers)
```

#### Discovery

Authorization servers advertise that they support clients using Client ID Metadata Documents by including the following property in their OAuth Authorization Server metadata:

```json
{
  "client_id_metadata_document_supported": true
}
```

MCP clients **SHOULD** check for this capability and **MAY** fall back to Dynamic Client Registration
or pre-registration if unavailable.

### Preregistration

MCP clients **SHOULD** support an option for static client credentials such as those supplied by a preregistration flow. This could be:

1. Hardcode a client ID (and, if applicable, client credentials) specifically for the MCP client to use when
   interacting with that authorization server, or
2. Present a UI to users that allows them to enter these details, after registering an
   OAuth client themselves (e.g., through a configuration interface hosted by the
   server).

### Dynamic Client Registration

MCP clients and authorization servers **MAY** support the
OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol [RFC7591](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7591)
to allow MCP clients to obtain OAuth client IDs without user interaction.
This option is included for backwards compatibility with earlier versions of the MCP authorization spec.

## Scope Selection Strategy

When implementing authorization flows, MCP clients **SHOULD** follow the principle of least privilege by requesting
only the scopes necessary for their intended operations. During the initial authorization handshake, MCP clients
**SHOULD** follow this priority order for scope selection:

1. **Use `scope` parameter** from the initial `WWW-Authenticate` header in the 401 response, if provided
2. **If `scope` is not available**, use all scopes defined in `scopes_supported` from the Protected Resource Metadata document, omitting the `scope` parameter if `scopes_supported` is undefined.

This approach accommodates the general-purpose nature of MCP clients, which typically lack domain-specific knowledge to make informed decisions about individual scope selection. Requesting all available scopes allows the authorization server and end-user to determine appropriate permissions during the consent process.

This approach minimizes user friction while following the principle of least privilege.
The `scopes_supported` field is intended to represent the minimal set of scopes necessary
for basic functionality (see [Scope Minimization](/specification/2025-11-25/basic/security_best_practices#scope-minimization)),
with additional scopes requested incrementally through the step-up authorization flow steps
described in the [Scope Challenge Handling](#scope-challenge-handling) section.

## Authorization Flow Steps

The complete Authorization flow proceeds as follows:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant B as User-Agent (Browser)
    participant C as Client
    participant M as MCP Server (Resource Server)
    participant A as Authorization Server

    C->>M: MCP request without token
    M->>C: HTTP 401 Unauthorized with WWW-Authenticate header
    Note over C: Extract resource_metadata URL from WWW-Authenticate

    C->>M: Request Protected Resource Metadata
    M->>C: Return metadata

    Note over C: Parse metadata and extract authorization server(s)<br/>Client determines AS to use

    C->>A: GET Authorization server metadata endpoint
    Note over C,A: Try OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect<br/>discovery endpoints in priority order
    A-->>C: Authorization server metadata

    alt Client ID Metadata Documents
        Note over C: Client uses HTTPS URL as client_id
        Note over A: Server detects URL-formatted client_id
        A->>C: Fetch metadata from client_id URL
        C-->>A: JSON metadata document
        Note over A: Validate metadata and redirect_uris
    else Dynamic client registration
        C->>A: POST /register
        A->>C: Client Credentials
    else Pre-registered client
        Note over C: Use existing client_id
    end

    Note over C: Generate PKCE parameters<br/>Include resource parameter<br/>Apply scope selection strategy
    C->>B: Open browser with authorization URL + code_challenge + resource
    B->>A: Authorization request with resource parameter
    Note over A: User authorizes
    A->>B: Redirect to callback with authorization code
    B->>C: Authorization code callback
    C->>A: Token request + code_verifier + resource
    A->>C: Access token (+ refresh token)
    C->>M: MCP request with access token
    M-->>C: MCP response
    Note over C,M: MCP communication continues with valid token
```

## Resource Parameter Implementation

MCP clients **MUST** implement Resource Indicators for OAuth 2.0 as defined in [RFC 8707](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8707.html)
to explicitly specify the target resource for which the token is being requested. The `resource` parameter:

1. **MUST** be included in both authorization requests and token requests.
2. **MUST** identify the MCP server that the client intends to use the token with.
3. **MUST** use the canonical URI of the MCP server as defined in [RFC 8707 Section 2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8707.html#name-access-token-request).

### Canonical Server URI

For the purposes of this specification, the canonical URI of an MCP server is defined as the resource identifier as specified in
[RFC 8707 Section 2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8707.html#section-2) and aligns with the `resource` parameter in
[RFC 9728](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728).

MCP clients **SHOULD** provide the most specific URI that they can for the MCP server they intend to access, following the guidance in [RFC 8707](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8707). While the canonical form uses lowercase scheme and host components, implementations **SHOULD** accept uppercase scheme and host components for robustness and interoperability.

Examples of valid canonical URIs:

- `https://mcp.example.com/mcp`
- `https://mcp.example.com`
- `https://mcp.example.com:8443`
- `https://mcp.example.com/server/mcp` (when path component is necessary to identify individual MCP server)

Examples of invalid canonical URIs:

- `mcp.example.com` (missing scheme)
- `https://mcp.example.com#fragment` (contains fragment)

> **Note:** While both `https://mcp.example.com/` (with trailing slash) and `https://mcp.example.com` (without trailing slash) are technically valid absolute URIs according to [RFC 3986](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986), implementations **SHOULD** consistently use the form without the trailing slash for better interoperability unless the trailing slash is semantically significant for the specific resource.

For example, if accessing an MCP server at `https://mcp.example.com`, the authorization request would include:

```
&resource=https%3A%2F%2Fmcp.example.com
```

MCP clients **MUST** send this parameter regardless of whether authorization servers support it.

## Access Token Usage

### Token Requirements

Access token handling when making requests to MCP servers **MUST** conform to the requirements defined in
[OAuth 2.1 Section 5 "Resource Requests"](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13#section-5).
Specifically:

1. MCP client **MUST** use the Authorization request header field defined in
   [OAuth 2.1 Section 5.1.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13#section-5.1.1):

```
Authorization: Bearer <access-token>
```

Note that authorization **MUST** be included in every HTTP request from client to server,
even if they are part of the same logical session.

2. Access tokens **MUST NOT** be included in the URI query string

Example request:

```http
GET /mcp HTTP/1.1
Host: mcp.example.com
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...
```

### Token Handling

MCP servers, acting in their role as an OAuth 2.1 resource server, **MUST** validate access tokens as described in
[OAuth 2.1 Section 5.2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13#section-5.2).
MCP servers **MUST** validate that access tokens were issued specifically for them as the intended audience,
according to [RFC 8707 Section 2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8707.html#section-2).
If validation fails, servers **MUST** respond according to
[OAuth 2.1 Section 5.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13#section-5.3)
error handling requirements. Invalid or expired tokens **MUST** receive a HTTP 401
response.

MCP clients **MUST NOT** send tokens to the MCP server other than ones issued by the MCP server's authorization server.

MCP servers **MUST** only accept tokens that are valid for use with their
own resources.

MCP servers **MUST NOT** accept or transit any other tokens.

## Error Handling

Servers **MUST** return appropriate HTTP status codes for authorization errors:

| Status Code | Description  | Usage                                      |
| ----------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| 401         | Unauthorized | Authorization required or token invalid    |
| 403         | Forbidden    | Invalid scopes or insufficient permissions |
| 400         | Bad Request  | Malformed authorization request            |

### Scope Challenge Handling

This section covers handling insufficient scope errors during runtime operations when
a client already has a token but needs additional permissions. This follows the error
handling patterns defined in [OAuth 2.1 Section 5](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13#section-5)
and leverages the metadata fields from [RFC 9728 (OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728).

#### Runtime Insufficient Scope Errors

When a client makes a request with an access token with insufficient
scope during runtime operations, the server **SHOULD** respond with:

- `HTTP 403 Forbidden` status code (per [RFC 6750 Section 3.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750#section-3.1))
- `WWW-Authenticate` header with the `Bearer` scheme and additional parameters:
  - `error="insufficient_scope"` - indicating the specific type of authorization failure
  - `scope="required_scope1 required_scope2"` - specifying the minimum scopes needed for the operation
  - `resource_metadata` - the URI of the Protected Resource Metadata document (for consistency with 401 responses)
  - `error_description` (optional) - human-readable description of the error

**Server Scope Management**: When responding with insufficient scope errors, servers
**SHOULD** include the scopes needed to satisfy the current request in the `scope`
parameter.

Servers have flexibility in determining which scopes to include:

- **Minimum approach**: Include the newly-required scopes for the specific operation. Include any existing granted scopes as well, if they are required, to prevent clients from losing previously granted permissions.
- **Recommended approach**: Include both existing relevant scopes and newly required scopes to prevent clients from losing previously granted permissions
- **Extended approach**: Include existing scopes, newly required scopes, and related scopes that commonly work together

The choice depends on the server's assessment of user experience impact and authorization friction.

Servers **SHOULD** be consistent in their scope inclusion strategy to provide predictable behavior for clients.

Servers **SHOULD** consider the user experience impact when determining which scopes to include in the
response, as misconfigured scopes may require frequent user interaction.

Example insufficient scope response:

```http
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
WWW-Authenticate: Bearer error="insufficient_scope",
                         scope="files:read files:write user:profile",
                         resource_metadata="https://mcp.example.com/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource",
                         error_description="Additional file write permission required"
```

#### Step-Up Authorization Flow

Clients will receive scope-related errors during initial authorization or at runtime (`insufficient_scope`).
Clients **SHOULD** respond to these errors by requesting a new access token with an increased set of scopes via a step-up authorization flow or handle the errors in other, appropriate ways.
Clients acting on behalf of a user **SHOULD** attempt the step-up authorization flow. Clients acting on their own behalf (`client_credentials` clients)
**MAY** attempt the step-up authorization flow or abort the request immediately.

The flow is as follows:

1. **Parse error information** from the authorization server response or `WWW-Authenticate` header
2. **Determine required scopes** as outlined in [Scope Selection Strategy](#scope-selection-strategy).
3. **Initiate (re-)authorization** with the determined scope set
4. **Retry the original request** with the new authorization no more than a few times and treat this as a permanent authorization failure

Clients **SHOULD** implement retry limits and **SHOULD** track scope upgrade attempts to avoid
repeated failures for the same resource and operation combination.

## Security Considerations

Implementations **MUST** follow OAuth 2.1 security best practices as laid out in [OAuth 2.1 Section 7. "Security Considerations"](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13#name-security-considerations).

### Token Audience Binding and Validation

[RFC 8707](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8707.html) Resource Indicators provide critical security benefits by binding tokens to their intended
audiences **when the Authorization Server supports the capability**. To enable current and future adoption:

- MCP clients **MUST** include the `resource` parameter in authorization and token requests as specified in the [Resource Parameter Implementation](#resource-parameter-implementation) section
- MCP servers **MUST** validate that tokens presented to them were specifically issued for their use

The [Security Best Practices document](/specification/2025-11-25/basic/security_best_practices#token-passthrough)
outlines why token audience validation is crucial and why token passthrough is explicitly forbidden.

### Token Theft

Attackers who obtain tokens stored by the client, or tokens cached or logged on the server can access protected resources with
requests that appear legitimate to resource servers.

Clients and servers **MUST** implement secure token storage and follow OAuth best practices,
as outlined in [OAuth 2.1, Section 7.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13#section-7.1).

Authorization servers **SHOULD** issue short-lived access tokens to reduce the impact of leaked tokens.
For public clients, authorization servers **MUST** rotate refresh tokens as described in [OAuth 2.1 Section 4.3.1 "Token Endpoint Extension"](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13#section-4.3.1).

### Communication Security

Implementations **MUST** follow [OAuth 2.1 Section 1.5 "Communication Security"](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13#section-1.5).

Specifically:

1. All authorization server endpoints **MUST** be served over HTTPS.
1. All redirect URIs **MUST** be either `localhost` or use HTTPS.

### Authorization Code Protection

An attacker who has gained access to an authorization code contained in an authorization response can try to redeem the authorization code for an access token or otherwise make use of the authorization code.
(Further described in [OAuth 2.1 Section 7.5](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13#section-7.5))

To mitigate this, MCP clients **MUST** implement PKCE according to [OAuth 2.1 Section 7.5.2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13#section-7.5.2) and **MUST** verify PKCE support before proceeding with authorization.
PKCE helps prevent authorization code interception and injection attacks by requiring clients to create a secret verifier-challenge pair, ensuring that only the original requestor can exchange an authorization code for tokens.

MCP clients **MUST** use the `S256` code challenge method when technically capable, as required by [OAuth 2.1 Section 4.1.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13#section-4.1.1).

Since OAuth 2.1 and PKCE specifications do not define a mechanism for clients to discover PKCE support, MCP clients **MUST** rely on authorization server metadata to verify this capability:

- **OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata**: If `code_challenge_methods_supported` is absent, the authorization server does not support PKCE and MCP clients **MUST** refuse to proceed.

- **OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0**: While the [OpenID Provider Metadata](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderMetadata) does not define `code_challenge_methods_supported`, this field is commonly included by OpenID providers. MCP clients **MUST** verify the presence of `code_challenge_methods_supported` in the provider metadata response. If the field is absent, MCP clients **MUST** refuse to proceed.

Authorization servers providing OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0 **MUST** include `code_challenge_methods_supported` in their metadata to ensure MCP compatibility.

### Open Redirection

An attacker may craft malicious redirect URIs to direct users to phishing sites.

MCP clients **MUST** have redirect URIs registered with the authorization server.

Authorization servers **MUST** validate exact redirect URIs against pre-registered values to prevent redirection attacks.

MCP clients **SHOULD** use and verify state parameters in the authorization code flow
and discard any results that do not include or have a mismatch with the original state.

Authorization servers **MUST** take precautions to prevent redirecting user agents to untrusted URI's, following suggestions laid out in [OAuth 2.1 Section 7.12.2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13#section-7.12.2)

Authorization servers **SHOULD** only automatically redirect the user agent if it trusts the redirection URI. If the URI is not trusted, the authorization server MAY inform the user and rely on the user to make the correct decision.

### Client ID Metadata Document Security

When implementing Client ID Metadata Documents, authorization servers **MUST** consider the security implications
detailed in [OAuth Client ID Metadata Document, Section 6](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-client-id-metadata-document-00#name-security-considerations).
Key considerations include:

#### Authorization Server Abuse Protection

The authorization server takes a URL as input from an unknown client and fetches that URL.
A malicious client could use this to trigger the authorization server to make requests to arbitrary URLs,
such as requests to private administration endpoints the authorization server has access to.

Authorization servers fetching metadata documents **SHOULD** consider
[Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Security/Attacks/SSRF) risks, as described in [OAuth Client ID Metadata Document: Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) Attacks](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-client-id-metadata-document-00#name-server-side-request-forgery).

#### Localhost Redirect URI Risks

Client ID Metadata Documents cannot prevent `localhost` URL impersonation by themselves. An attacker can claim to be any client by:

1. Providing the legitimate client's metadata URL as their `client_id`
2. Binding to the any `localhost` port, and providing that address as the redirect_uri
3. Receiving the authorization code via the redirect when the user approves

The server will see the legitimate client's metadata document and the user will see the legitimate client's name, making attack detection difficult.

Authorization servers:

- **SHOULD** display additional warnings for `localhost`-only redirect URIs
- **MAY** require additional attestation mechanisms for enhanced security
- **MUST** clearly display the redirect URI hostname during authorization

#### Trust Policies

Authorization servers **MAY** implement domain-based trust policies:

- Allowlists for trusted domains (for protected servers)
- Accept any HTTPS `client_id` (for open servers)
- Reputation checks for unknown domains
- Restrictions based on domain age or certificate validation
- Display the CIMD and other associated client hostnames prominently to prevent phishing

Servers maintain full control over their access policies.

### Confused Deputy Problem

Attackers can exploit MCP servers acting as intermediaries to third-party APIs, leading to [confused deputy vulnerabilities](/specification/2025-11-25/basic/security_best_practices#confused-deputy-problem).
By using stolen authorization codes, they can obtain access tokens without user consent.

MCP proxy servers using static client IDs **MUST** obtain user consent for each dynamically
registered client before forwarding to third-party authorization servers (which may require additional consent).

### Access Token Privilege Restriction

An attacker can gain unauthorized access or otherwise compromise an MCP server if the server accepts tokens issued for other resources.

This vulnerability has two critical dimensions:

1. **Audience validation failures.** When an MCP server doesn't verify that tokens were specifically intended for it (for example, via the audience claim, as mentioned in [RFC9068](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9068.html)), it may accept tokens originally issued for other services. This breaks a fundamental OAuth security boundary, allowing attackers to reuse legitimate tokens across different services than intended.
2. **Token passthrough.** If the MCP server not only accepts tokens with incorrect audiences but also forwards these unmodified tokens to downstream services, it can potentially cause the ["confused deputy" problem](#confused-deputy-problem), where the downstream API may incorrectly trust the token as if it came from the MCP server or assume the token was validated by the upstream API. See the [Token Passthrough section](/specification/2025-11-25/basic/security_best_practices#token-passthrough) of the Security Best Practices guide for additional details.

MCP servers **MUST** validate access tokens before processing the request, ensuring the access token is issued specifically for the MCP server, and take all necessary steps to ensure no data is returned to unauthorized parties.

A MCP server **MUST** follow the guidelines in [OAuth 2.1 - Section 5.2](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13.html#section-5.2) to validate inbound tokens.

MCP servers **MUST** only accept tokens specifically intended for themselves and **MUST** reject tokens that do not include them in the audience claim or otherwise verify that they are the intended recipient of the token. See the [Security Best Practices Token Passthrough section](/specification/2025-11-25/basic/security_best_practices#token-passthrough) for details.

If the MCP server makes requests to upstream APIs, it may act as an OAuth client to them. The access token used at the upstream API is a separate token, issued by the upstream authorization server. The MCP server **MUST NOT** pass through the token it received from the MCP client.

MCP clients **MUST** implement and use the `resource` parameter as defined in [RFC 8707 - Resource Indicators for OAuth 2.0](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8707.html)
to explicitly specify the target resource for which the token is being requested. This requirement aligns with the recommendation in
[RFC 9728 Section 7.4](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728#section-7.4). This ensures that access tokens are bound to their intended resources and
cannot be misused across different services.

## MCP Authorization Extensions

There are several authorization extensions to the core protocol that define additional authorization mechanisms. These extensions are:

- **Optional** - Implementations can choose to adopt these extensions
- **Additive** - Extensions do not modify or break core protocol functionality; they add new capabilities while preserving core protocol behavior
- **Composable** - Extensions are modular and designed to work together without conflicts, allowing implementations to adopt multiple extensions simultaneously
- **Versioned independently** - Extensions follow the core MCP versioning cycle but may adopt independent versioning as needed

A list of supported extensions can be found in the [MCP Authorization Extensions](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/ext-auth) repository.
