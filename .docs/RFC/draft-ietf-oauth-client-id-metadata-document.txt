                   OAuth Client ID Metadata Document
            draft-ietf-oauth-client-id-metadata-document-00

Abstract

   This specification defines a mechanism through which an OAuth client
   can identify itself to authorization servers, without prior dynamic
   client registration or other existing registration.  This is through
   the usage of a URL as a client_id in an OAuth flow, where the URL
   refers to a document containing the necessary client metadata,
   enabling the authorization server to fetch the metadata about the
   client as needed.

1.  Introduction

   In order for an OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749] client to utilize an OAuth 2.0
   authorization server, the client needs to establish a unique
   identifier, and needs to to provide the server with metadata about
   the application, such as the application name, icon and redirect
   URIs.  In cases where a client is interacting with authorization
   servers that it has no relationship with, manual registration is
   impossible.

   While Dynamic Client Registration [RFC7591] can provide a method for
   a previously unknown client to establish itself at an authorization
   server and obtain a client identifier, this is not always practical
   in some deployments and can create additional challenges around
   management of the registration data and cleanup of inactive clients.

   This specification describes how an OAuth 2.0 client can publish its
   own registration information and avoid the need for pre-registering
   at each authorization server.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Client Identifier

   This specification defines the client identifier as a URL with the
   following restrictions.  Client identifier URLs MUST have an "https"
   scheme, MUST contain a path component, MUST NOT contain single-dot or
   double-dot path segments, MUST NOT contain a fragment component and
   MUST NOT contain a username or password Client identifier URLs SHOULD
   NOT include a query string component, and MAY contain a port.

   This specification places no restrictions on what URL is used as a
   client identifier.  A short URL is RECOMMENDED, since the URL may be
   displayed to the end user in the authorization interface or in
   management interfaces.  Usage of a stable URL that does not
   frequently change for the client is also RECOMMENDED.

4.  Client Information Discovery

   One purpose of registering clients at the authorization server is so
   that the authorization server has additional information about the
   client that can be used during an OAuth flow, such as presenting
   information about the client to the user in an authorization consent
   screen, for example the client name and logo.

   The authorization server SHOULD fetch the document indicated by the
   client_id to retrieve the client registration information.

4.1.  Client Metadata

   The client metadata document URL is a JSON document containing the
   metadata of the client.  The client metadata values are the values
   defined in the OAuth Dynamic Client Registration Metadata OAuth
   Parameters registry https://www.iana.org/assignments/oauth-
   parameters/oauth-parameters.xhtml#client-metadata
   (https://www.iana.org/assignments/oauth-parameters/oauth-
   parameters.xhtml#client-metadata).

   The client metadata document MUST contain a client_id property whose
   value MUST match the URL of the document using simple string
   comparison as defined in [RFC3986] Section 6.2.1.

   The client metadata document MAY define additional properties in the
   response.  The client metadata document MAY also be served with more
   specific content types as long as the response is JSON and conforms
   to application/<AS-defined>+json.

   As there is no way to establish a shared secret to be used with
   client metadata documents, the following restrictions apply on the
   contents of the client metadata document:

   *  the token_endpoint_auth_method property MUST NOT include
      client_secret_post, client_secret_basic, client_secret_jwt, or any
      other method based around a shared symmetric secret.

   *  the client_secret and client_secret_expires_at properties MUST NOT
      be used

   See Section 6.2 for more details.

   Other specifications MAY place additional restrictions on the
   contents of the client metadata document accepted by authorization
   servers implementing their specification, for instance, preventing
   the registration of confidential clients by requiring the
   token_endpoint_auth_method property be set to "none".

Internet-Draft             Client ID Document               October 2025


   TBD: We may want a property such as client_id_expires_at for
   indicating that the client is ephemeral and not valid after a given
   timestamp, especially for documents issued by a service for
   development purposes.

4.2.  Client Metadata Documents for Development Purposes

   An authorization server may have restrictions on what it accepts as
   valid redirect_uris, for instance, limiting them to the same-origin
   as the client_id or client_uri properties.  However, if an
   authorization server does place additional restrictions on the
   accepted redirect_uris then it SHOULD provide at least one Client ID
   Metadata Document Service (described below) which is exempt from
   these restrictions.

   When developing applications against an authorization server which
   uses this specification, developers often encounter the issue of "how
   do I serve a Client ID Metadata Document at a publicly accessible
   https URL whilst developing my application on my localhost?".

   To enable developers to author applications on their machines,
   without exposing their machines to the public internet, the usage of
   Client ID Metadata Document Services by the authorization server is
   RECOMMENDED.

   A Client ID Metadata Document Service is a web service through which
   developers can acquire a stable URL to a Client ID Metadata Document.
   This service MAY expire clients from time to time, and MAY require
   developers to provide additional information about the client being
   developed.

   By providing at least one Client ID Metadata Document Service, an
   authorization server can enable developers to create applications,
   and still indicate to non-technical people that the client that they
   are about to authorize is currently under-development and may not be
   trustworthy or secure.

4.3.  Metadata Discovery Errors

   If fetching the metadata document fails, the authorization server
   SHOULD abort the authorization request.

4.4.  Metadata Caching

   The authorization server MAY cache the client metadata it discovers
   at the client metadata document URL.





Parecki & Smith           Expires 11 April 2026                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft             Client ID Document               October 2025


   The authorization server SHOULD respect HTTP cache headers [RFC9111]
   when caching client metadata, but MAY define its own upper and/or
   lower bounds on an acceptable cache lifetime as well.

   The authorization server MUST NOT cache error responses.  The
   authorization server also MUST NOT cache documents which are invalid
   or malformed.

4.5.  Redirect URL Registration

   According to [RFC9700], the authorization server MUST require
   registration of redirect URIs, and MUST ensure that the redirect URI
   in a request is an exact match of a registered redirect URI.

   This method of client information discovery establishes a registered
   redirect URI with the authorization server which is used when
   comparing the redirect URI in an authorization request against the
   registered redirect URIs.

5.  Authorization Server Metadata

   Authorization servers that publish Authorization Server Metadata
   [RFC8414] MUST include the following property to signal support for
   client metadata documents as described in this specification.

   client_id_metadata_document_supported:  OPTIONAL.  Boolean value
      specifying whether the authorization server supports retrieving
      client metadata from a client_id URL as described in this
      specification.

   This enables clients to avoid sending the user to a dead end, by only
   redirecting the user to an authorization server that supports this
   specification.  Otherwise, the client would redirect the user and the
   user would be met with an error about an invalid client as described
   by Section 4.1.2.1 of [RFC6749].

6.  Security Considerations

   In addition to the security considerations in OAuth 2.0 Core
   [RFC6749], and OAuth 2.0 Threat Model and Security Considerations
   [RFC6819], and [RFC9700] the additional considerations apply.

Internet-Draft             Client ID Document               October 2025


6.1.  Relationship between redirect_uris and client_id or client_uri

   An authorization server MAY impose restrictions or relationships
   between the redirect_uris and the client_id or client_uri properties,
   for example to restrict the redirect_uri to the same-origin as the
   Client ID Metadata Document.  Without restrictions like these, there
   are potential trust and safety issues where the client attempts to
   impersonate a more well-known client or otherwise act in a way which
   is malicious or puts the end-user at risk.

   Having no restrictions on the relationship between redirect_uris and
   client_id or client_uri was a common practice with [Solid-OIDC]'s
   Client ID Documents, so this ability is preserved for backwards
   compatibility between [Solid-OIDC] and this specification.

   Some restrictions on redirect_uris can make developer usage of Client
   ID Metadata Documents difficult.  The section Section 4.2 contains
   recommendations for enabling development usage of Client ID Metadata
   Documents for authorization servers that impose restrictions on the
   redirect_uri.

6.2.  Client Authentication

   Since the client establishes its own registration data at the
   authorization server, prior coordination of client credentials is not
   possible.  However, clients MAY establish credentials at the
   authorization server by using authentication methods that use public/
   private key pairs, by publishing the public key in their metadata
   document.

   For example, the client MAY include the following properties in its
   metadata document to establish a public key and advertise the
   private_key_jwt authentication method defined in [OpenID]:

   {
     ...
     "token_endpoint_auth_method": "private_key_jwt",
     "jwks_uri": "https://client.example.com/jwks.json"
     ...
   }

   This establishes this client as a confidential client, and any
   communication with the authorization server MUST include client
   authentication of the registered type.

   The particular method of how the client manages the private key is
   out of scope of this specification, but may include manual
   provisioning or methods such as Attestation Based Client

Internet-Draft             Client ID Document               October 2025


   Authentication [I-D.draft-ietf-oauth-attestation-based-client-auth].
   For example, the client developer could run a Client Attester
   Backend, using a native application's platform-specific APIs to
   authenticate to the backend service, where the private key
   corresponding to the jwks_uri key is managed by the backend service.
   This would allow a mobile app to request JWTs from the backend
   service that the mobile app could then use as client authentication
   to the authorization server.

6.3.  Changes in Client Keys

   If the authorization server notices that the jwks_uri or the contents
   at the jwks_uri have changed compared to the last time it fetched the
   metadata, the authorization server MAY take actions such as revoking
   any tokens issued to this client, or revoking the user's consent for
   this client.  The particular actions to take are left up to the
   discretion of the authorization server based on its own risk
   assessment.

6.4.  OAuth Phishing Attacks

   Authorization servers SHOULD fetch the client_id metadata document
   provided in the authorization request in order to provide users with
   additional information about the request, such as the application
   name and logo.  If the server does not fetch the client metadata
   document, then it SHOULD take additional measures to ensure the user
   is provided with as much information as possible about the request.

   The authorization server SHOULD display the hostname of the client_id
   on the authorization interface, in addition to displaying the fetched
   client information if any.  Displaying the hostname helps users know
   that they are authorizing the expected application.

   If fetching the client metadata document fails for any reason, the
   client_id URL is the only piece of information the user has as an
   indication of which application they are authorizing.

6.5.  Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) Attacks

   Authorization servers fetching the client metadata document and
   resolving URLs located in the metadata document should be aware of
   possible SSRF attacks.  Authorization servers SHOULD avoid fetching
   any URLs using private or loopback addresses and consider network
   policies or other measures to prevent making requests to these
   addresses.  Authorization servers SHOULD also be aware of the
   possibility that URLs might be non-http-based URI schemes which can
   lead to other possible SSRF attack vectors.

Internet-Draft             Client ID Document               October 2025


6.6.  Maximum Response Size for Client Metadata Documents

   Authorization servers SHOULD limit the response size when fetching
   the client metadata document, as to avoid denial of service attacks
   against the authorization server by consuming excessive resources
   (memory, disk, database).  The recommended maximum response size for
   client metadata documents is 5 kilobytes.

6.7.  Displaying Logos to End-Users

   Authorization servers that wish to make use of the logo_uri property
   within client metadata document SHOULD prefetch the file at logo_uri
   and cache it for the cache duration of the client metadata document.
   This allows for moderation tools to verify the file contents (e.g.,
   preventing usage of logos that look like other logos), as well as
   preventing the logo from being dynamically changed to confuse an end-
   user.

   Caching of the logo_uri response can additionally prevent cross-
   domain tracking through the logo_uri being requested by the client,
   since the cached file would be served not from the remote URI but
   instead from a URI that the Authorization server trusts.

6.8.  Client ID Domain Trust

   The authorization server MAY choose to have its own heuristics and
   policies around the trust of domain names used as client IDs.

   For example, the authorization server could require that the first
   100 users to authorize a client_id see an additional warning screen
   before the OAuth consent screen.  The authorization server could
   check attributes of the domain reputation, such as how recently the
   domain was registered, and put up extra warnings for new domains.

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  OAuth Authorization Server Metadata Registry

   The following authorization server metadata value is defined by this
   specification and registered in the IANA "OAuth Authorization Server
   Metadata" registry established in OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server
   Metadata [RFC8414].

   *  Metadata Name: client_id_metadata_document_supported:

   *  Metadata Description: JSON boolean value specifying whether the
      authorization server supports retrieving client metadata from a
      client_id URL.

Acknowledgments

   The idea of using URIs as the client_id in OAuth based authorization
   requests is not new, and has previously been specified in varying
   ways by [IndieAuth], [Solid-OIDC], and [OpenID.Federation].  This
   specification is largely inspired by the work of Aaron Coburn, elf
   Pavlik, and Dmitri Zagidulin in their [Solid-OIDC] specification
   which defined dereferenceable Client Identifier Documents.
